<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: medium;"> <span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;"><span style="color: #000000;">Early in the nineteenth century England was at war with France, and this was causing hardship at home, with many in the West Riding petitioning for peace. </span></span><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;"><span style="color: #000000;">Wool imports were restricted by the conflict, and </span><span style="color: blue;"> </span><span style="color: #000000;">clothiers were struggling to make a living. their profits and had difficulty in retaining a profit margin. There was already a practice of utilising waste such as noils, the short fibres discarded by the combing process in worsted manufacture, thrums, then ends trimmed from the warp when a piece was removed from the loom, and flocks.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: medium;"> <span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;"><span style="color: #000000;">Batley resident</span></span><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;"><span style="color: #000000;"> <a href="p7.htm#i202"><strong>Benjamin Law</strong></a>, a clothier whose enterprise was sufficiently substantial to be, along with others, in partnership with a London agent, developed a process of tearing up woollen rags in such a fashion that he could use the resulting  material  to make cloth, Although </span><span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: #000000;">misfortune later hit Benjamin, who was to leave Batley, dying in in 1837 in Stockport</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000000;">, the use of this material, Shoddy, developed into a local </span>speciality which transformed Batley, and was to shape my family history for some century and a half.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: medium;">  <span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;"><span style="color: #000000;">For information as to how Law's contribution came about we rely mainly on later accounts. </span></span><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;"><span style="color: #000000;">When <a href="p75.htm#i2244">Samuel Jubb</a> wrote his <strong>&ldquo;History of the Shoddy Trade; its rise, progress and present position</strong>&rdquo; in 1860 he wrote <em>&ldquo;It is uncertain as to who first produced ragwool or shoddy, but the presumption is in favour of Mr Benjamin Law;</em> <em>several persons here appear to have almost simultaneously commenced running rag machines."</em> </span></span><span style="color: red; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: medium;"> <span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;"><span style="color: #000000;">When <a href="p129.htm#i3884">Edwin Law</a>, grandson both of Law and Law&rsquo;s brother-in-law Benjamin Parr, who had married sisters Lydia and Elizabeth Sheard, came across a copy of Jubb's book in 1869, he wrote to the Leeds Mercury with some indignation.<sup>1</sup> </span></span> <span class="mini"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="color: #000000;">Here he makes an important distinction in saying quite clearly that Law had no claim to be the first <span style="text-decoration: underline;">producer of shoddy</span>. He tells us that what happened was that when in London Law called on a saddler with whom he had formerly done business in the hope of selling him some flocks. The saddler told him that they now had a substitute which served their purpose. He examined a sample of what came to be known as shoddy, and perceived that it might be usable for making cloth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It was this realisation and its development that we owe to Benjamin Law.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: medium;"> <span class="mini"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">In an important article in the Batley Reporter in 1880 entitled "<strong>The Discovery and Early History of th</strong></span></span></span></span><span class="mini"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"><strong>e Shoddy and Mungo trades"</strong>,<sup>2</sup> Law placed the first manufacture of shoddy cloth in 1909. He refers to information from <a href="p73.htm#i2188">Joseph Parker</a>, whose family had been near neighbours of the Law family until 1811, and who recalled Law carrying on the business before that time. He mentions information which Parker had from London warehouseman <a href="p312.htm#i8623">James Gunnis</a> in 1843 which corroborated Edwin's earlier statement that Law had first seen shoddy in the saddlers shop, and subsequently purchased it, principally from those who were tearing up rags as filling for saddles. </span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: medium;"> <span class="mini"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">It was in 1808 that Law pulled out of a partnership with Gunnis and two other Batley men, <a href="500">George Newsome</a> and <a style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" href="file:///C:/Users/Vivien/AppData/Local/Temp/ssHtmlEditor/%3C%=Page.PersonHREF(103)%>">John Sheard</a> which could well indicate that this was the time at which Law came to feel that his idea represented a viable proposition. </span></span></span></span></span><span style="font-size: medium;">Edwin says that at first Benjamin sent rags to Brighouse where there were some machines for tearing up the twisted thrums, but that the first machine set up for the purpose was one belonging to a Mr Fozard at Howley Mill., then a water powered corn mill.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;"><span class="mini"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"><a style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;" href="file:///C:/Users/Vivien/AppData/Local/Temp/ssHtmlEditor/%3C%=Page.PersonHREF(103)John%20Sheard%3C/a%3E,%20which%20could%20well%20indicate%20that%20it%20was%20 at%20this%20time%20that%20he%20felt%20that%20his%20idea%20was%20a%20viable%20proposition.%3C/span%3E%3C/span%3E%3C/span%3E%3C/span%3E%3C/span%3E%3C/div%3E%3Cdiv%20class="><span style="font-size: medium;"> </span></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<div id="ui61" class="spi spileft" style="width:700px;"><img alt="" src="Benny Parr Wood 2 (2).jpg" width="700" height="461"><div class="spic">Howley Mill © image courtesy of Erica Parr</div></div><p class="MsoNormal" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;">A Mr Farrar Fenton, not of local origin but one who took an interest in the matter and made enquiries, believed the Brighouse machines were made by a Mr Gibson from Cleckheaton, and that a Mr Fozzard from Leeds took a room and power at Howley and installed one of machines for preparing thrums, working there for some time before Law and Parr carried out their experiments with it.<sup>3</sup></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><em>(a Joseph Gibson who appears in the 1841 census as a machine maker at Wool Row, Cleckheaton employing three apprentices, his age then given as 60, seems likely.)</em></span> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;">Fozzards were the family already at Howley as corn millers; whether another Fozzard, perhaps a connection, came from Leeds I cannot tell. </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;">It seems to have become evident that better machines were required, and early experiments with currry comb teeth mounted on rollers which turned against each other gave way to ones with tougher conical teeth. Joseph Archer, an Ossett machine maker, was credited by Fenton with developing the rag machines, and although Edwin Law in a reply took issue with Fenton's assertion that they were of Parr's invention, pointing out that Parr was a manufacturer, not a machinist, he does not deny some involvement of Mr Archer.</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;">Although Law had attempted to keep his experiments secret, this was not to last for long. <span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;">it is hard to see how the arrival of loads of rags and their subsequent processing could have gone entirely unnoticed, </span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;">or indeed have aroused the curiousity of </span><span style="color: #202020;">his former partners and their associates. It is not surprising that others, noticing Law's success in difficult times, sought to emulate what he was doing. </span></span>Edwin Law was of the opinion that others were using shoddy by 1812, and was told by Parker that it had taken hold by 1813, and that when he, Parker, went as an apprentice to John and Phineas Fox it was to learn the shoddy trade.<sup>4</sup>. <a href="p75.htm#i2237">Joseph Jubb</a> is said to have gone with a mechanic to look  the Brighouse machine on the pretence of buying thrums and though the latter was not allowed in, saw enough to make a copy which this account says he set up at Howley. <sup>5</sup> The rag machines were ones which needed power, in limited supply in Batley,and &lt;a href="p12.htm#i365"&gt;John Burnley is said to have set one up in his barn, operated by a donkey gin.<sup>6</sup></span></span></p>

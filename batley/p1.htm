He was the son of <a href="p123.htm#i3723">Norman William <span class="ns">Eley</span></a> and <a href="#i5">Ann Eliza <span class="ns">Blackburn</span></a>. <br><br><b><span style="font-size:13pt;">Brian Eley's Account of a Batley Childhood</span></b><br><br>I was born on the 18th April 1908 in the front bedroom of "The Red House",Bradford Road, Batley. <a href="e18.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Dad's sketch of the Red House; collection V.E. Tomlinson"></a> My birthplace had earlier been the residence of my great-grandfather, <a href="#i49">John <span class="ns">Blackburn</span></a> , the founder of the family business, <b>"John Blackburn, Old Mill"</b> a few hundred yards along the road. My father, Dr N. W. Eley, had come to Batley to work with Drs. Keighley and Woods, and there had met his wife Anne Eliza Blackburn.<br>The Bradford Road house had been enlarged and developed to include a surgery, waiting room and dispensary. Medicines were usually prepared on the premises in those days. I can recall seeing the patients coming and going, and the waiting room busy, and also watching the dispenser at work. Supplies of new medicines were kept in crates or boxes in the cellar, and I remember them being covered with water when Batley Beck overflowed its banks and Bradford Road was extensively flooded.<br>My father had a motor-cycle and sidecar,motor cars still being very rare. I was sometimes put in the sidecar and accompanied my Dad on his rounds. Even in the 1980s I met people who remembered making a fuss of that blonde infant. At home I liked to help on the weekly baking day, and was given a bit of dough to make my own cottage loaf which was super for breakfast the next morning. I played in the small garden at the front with a flat topped horse toy, and had a substantial metal and wood toy train with engine, trucks and guard's van which I used to pull along the footpaths after me, somtimes taking it to the <b>Old Mill</b> when we went to feed the horses, other times going up to the top of Soothill to visit friends. There were plenty of aunts and uncles near at hand with cousins to play with, and at Christmas family parties in each other's houses and visits to Leeds Grand for Pantomimes.<br>My parents had a long wait for a second child, and by the time my brother Alan was born I was eight and a schoolboy. Schooling began at a small kindergarten run by a Miss Lister in Grosvenor Road, almost opposite St. Thomas's Church.<br><br>(<i>My father does not mention awareness of the outbreak of the First World War, but there would have been gaps in the family circle by this time, with Uncles Vyner Graham , Tom Blackburn and Cyril Stubley amongst family members serving in France. Life was soon to change for him.)</i><br><br>My father had volunteered to join the Army Medical corps and was near to joining up when, after visiting sick patients when under the weather himself, he contracted influenza, which turned to pneumonia and pleurisy. I remember terrible uncontrollable coughing, and early in 1917 he died.<br>I never knew what if anything was arranged to carry on medical services on the premises, but it was considered desirable for the family to move as soon as possible. Enquiries were made. We moved within a week to a suitable house about a mile away, one of a pair of three storied semis called Mostyn Villas, near Lady Anne's (railway) Crossing, and with a pleasant view towards Howley.<a href="e2.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Mostyn Villas, &#169; V E Tomlinson March 2007"></a> Just over the wall alongside the approach to the house at the rear was "Swiss House" where Uncle Cyril and Aunt Ethel had set up home. I had already had some training helping with Grandpa Blackburn's garden when his gardener was called up for war service, and lawns at the front and side of Mostyn Villas with surrounding flower beds pestered with bindweed, and a kitchen garden, were plenty for a nine year old to tackle. I organised some hens to provide fresh eggs, and a two storey hen-house meant they could go upstairs at bedtime.<br><br>By then I was attending a Miss. Sturt's school on Halifax Road, Dewsbury, which entailed getting a tram to Batley Carr, but soon it was decided that I was to transfer to Batley Grammar School. There,despite the war I remember lively German language tuition, reading, writing and singing in German, but also being shown how to convert grassland to productive ground for growing food to help the war effort.<br><br>There were visits to relatives and friends in Scarborough, , and on the evening of the 4th September 1917 I was out fishing in the South Bay there with my grandfather and a friend, a Mr. Denton, in a boat manned by a local fisherman. Suddenly a German U-boat surfaced and shells whistled overhead, aimed at the town and at some minesweepers in the harbour.  Grandpa said, duck!, lad, duck!, as along with other boats we made harbourwards.<br> (<i>The minesweepers seem to have been caught napping, but got up steam and  the U-boat turned tail at their approach. Although three people were killed in the town, the damage was not as severe as an earlier bombardment in 1914)</i> <br>Our party were unscathed, and made our way to the residence on the South Esplanade where we were staying. There we found that other family members had spent the time in the cellar praying!<br><br> Brian <i>tells us</i> "Soon after the war Grandpa Blackburn decided to retire to Scarborough  and my mother <a href="#i5">Ann Eliza</a> decided to move there too, so I was to leave the West Riding for a while."<br><br> <i>Brian Eley acquired a step-father when his mother married <a href="p10.htm#i289">Rennie Orenza <span class="ns">Vasey</span></a> her cousin on 12 February 1920 at Scarborough <i>and later there were to be three half-brothers. He attended Scarborough College as a weekly boarder, but my impression is that little thought was given to career options. </i></i> <i>My father continues:</i>-<br><br>"The family shoddy business was, I suppose, at least subconsciously in my mind through my long comradeship with my grandpa. Without warning, soon after my school days had finished, my uncle, Fred Blackburn called to see us in Scarborough to ask if I would like to join his half of the family business. It seems that he and his brother John Sheard Blackburn, who was also interested in employing me, had not been happy working in tandem at the Old Mill, and had agreed to split, Fred's half being a new venture in Ravensthorpe. I agreed to work for Fred.<br> The premises which <a href="#i45">Fred <span class="ns">Blackburn</span></a> found in 1925 were single storey buildings in Church Street, Ravensthorpe, and had previously been used for the manufacture of Bell motor cars. He equipped them with eight rag machines and a rag shaker, and there were warehouses, an oil tank room and a baling room as well as office and sampling areas.<a href="e26.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Church Street Mill Ravensthorpe: collection V. E. Tomlinson"></a> <br>I found lodgings at Transvaal Terrace, Batley.<a href="e105.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a> <br><br>I was expected to have a thorough training, and started with rag sorting, most of my colleagues then being ladies of Irish descent. I attended evening classes in a range of textile subjects at Dewsbury Technical college.<br><br><i>(A couple of surviving certificates seem to represent part of a five year course, and show good grades for spinning, weaving and cloth</i> <i>finishing.).</i><br><br> <i>There was a  move to more convenient lodgings in Ravensthorpe, and my father must have progressed from sorting, for by the age of 21, with otherwise low outgoings, he was able to run a car, taking lessons from the then mill lorry driver. I believe his first car was a Wolseley Hornet, but later came a baby Austin. Social life must have developed, for he came to feel a lack of dancing skills, and went to classes, and there met my mother.</i> <br>Brian Eley married <a href="#i2">Grace <span class="ns">Senior</span></a>, daughter of <a href="p15.htm#i451">Arthur <span class="ns">Senior</span></a> and <a href="p15.htm#i452">Sarah Grace Gertrude <span class="ns">Binns</span></a>, on 9 September 1933 at Batley Parish Church.<sup>1</sup><br> Brian and <a href="#i2">Grace</a> made their first home in a newly built semi-detached house at Flash Lane, Mirfield.  Brian Eley was to have a long residence in Mirfield, interrupted only by the war years. At the beginning of the war he was in the Auxiliary Fire Service, then on being called up trained as a radio mechanic and served with the Eighth Army in Algeria, Egypt and Italy.<br><br> He returned to the mill afterwards, and although the business was sold on his uncle's death, this did him no harm, and for a long time up to his retirement he was a director and works manager.<br> Later life saw a wide involvement in local affairs including serving on first Mirfield and then Kirklees Councils. <br> <br>Brian Eley died on 28 April 1997 at Mirfield, Yorkshire, at age 89.</div>

Their father was then over 70 but had been actively involved in Council matters, taking a second term as Mayor during the difficult wartime years. They do not seem to have been content to work in tandem, and in the 1920s, after discussion with their father, it was agreed to split the business, Fred to operate his own firm in Ravensthorpe, and customers seemingly being split geographically. John Sheard Blackburn's involvement with the Old Mill continued until his own last illness and death in 1949. He died on 1 December 1949 at Harrogate at age 77. His body was cremated on 5 December 1949 at Harrogate.</div>

The bodice was trimmed with chiffon and orange blossom, and had transparent chiffon sleeves, the whole effect being enhanced by a lovely real Honiton lace veil falling to the train. She carried a pretty shower bouquet, composed of white roses, lily of the valley, stephanotis, asparagus fern and maidenhair, and wore a diamond brooch, the gift of the bridegroom. The bridesmaids were Miss Gertie Blackburn (sister of the bride), Miss Annie Graham (sister of the bridegroom), Miss Florence Carter, and Miss Ethel Blackburn (sister of the bride). The two former wore white muslin dreses with entredeux of lace inserted over turquise blue silk, their hats being of white satin straw, trimmed with white chiffon, edged with blue ribbon, one ostrich tip being caught with a handsome turquoise and paste buckle. They wore gold signet rings, with the initials of the bride and bridegroom, these being the gift of the latter. They carried bouquets of yellow marguerites and asparagus ferns. Miss Florence Carter and Miss Ethel Blackburn (the two younger bridesmaids) were dressed in frocks of ivory satin (Charles ! period) with bonnets of drawn white chiffon and ostrich tips, and wore gold bangles, which also bore the initials of the bride and bridegroom, and were presents from Mr Graham. They carried baskets of white marguerites and ferns. The two younger sisters of the bride, Miss Beatrice Blackburn and Miss Annie Blackburn, who attended as guests, were prettily attired in pale grey canvas over white, trimmed with white silk and chiffon, and wore white hats, trimmed with pink and white chiffon and white wings. They held bouquets of light pink roses."</i><br>We learn also that the bride's mother, Eliza Rebecca (seated on the left) was <i>"handsomely attired in black grenadine over turquoise silk, the trimming being of chenille and steel applique over blue chiffon - bonnet to match. She carried a bouquet of deep scarlet</i> roses<i>."<br></i><br> We are told that all these dresses were made at Mrs. C. W. Bunnings, Market Place, Dewsbury, whilst Mrs Senior of Wakefield catered in a highly satisfactory style, refreshments being served in a marquee on the lawn. Messrs B.W. Crossley and Son did the flowers, assisted by Mr. Parker, the gardener at Field House, who himself arranged a large display of hot house plants.<a href="e17.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></div>

She also wore a lovely picture hat of black panne velvet draped with tulle and handsome feathers."<sup>3</sup> </i><br><i></i> <br> Harry Blackburn lived at Mostyn Villaswhen first married.<sup>3</sup><br> After a time  Harry and  <a href="p11.htm#i330">Emma Beatrice</a>  moved into "The Laurels" in Upper Batley, a house which apears to be an adaptation of the outbuildings of Samuel Senior's "The Rookery".<sup>3,4</sup> <br> In the census of 2 April 1911 he was listed as the head of household at Mostyn Villa, Batley, as a rug manufacturer. There is one female servant.<sup>5</sup><br> Harry Blackburn served for a time on Batley Council.<br>  In 1920 the Batley News says of Harry Blackburn that he is <i>"emigrating to Australia with some workers to set up a new branch in Sydney. His brother T A Blackburn will take charge of business in Batley.<sup>3</sup></i>"<br> He set up a carpet business at Belmont Street, Alexandria, in 1920, but this venture soon seems to have failed, for in March 1922 we find him assigning his estate for the benefit of creditors.<br>Emma Beatrice and the children went out to join him in 1921, going to a cottage in Enfield which Harry had taken for them. However, their marriage seems to have been already breaking down and they were to live seperately. Harry supposedly paid Emma an allowance of &#163;7 per week, but, in financial difficulties himself, this was not always forthcoming. He is believed to have asked his father for money, but it is not clear if help was given. Certainly there was hardship and Emma had to sell her wedding presents and Harry some personal effects. Little is known of Harry's subsequent life, but his death in 1933 was attributable to heavy drinking. <br> John Wiliam Blackburn must have been informed of his son's death, and although we do not know if he was giving earlier support, Emma is remembered with a modest allowance in his will.<sup>3</sup><br> He died on 23 April 1933 at Bateman's Bay, New South Wales, Australia, at age 56.<sup>3</sup> He was buried in 1933 at Bateman's Bay, New South Wales, Australia. </div>

He was the son of <a href="p2.htm#i63">William <span class="ns">Blackburn</span></a> and <a href="p2.htm#i64">Sarah <span class="ns">Thompson</span></a>. John Blackburn was baptized on 27 May 1821 at Batley.<sup>1</sup><br><br> An obituary describes him as the son of a manufacturer in a small way of business, and quotes his own account of winding bobbins and whipping blankets when only five years of age, working in the tentering fields before he was six, and having pieces of cloth thrown on his shoulder at ten, with an extra "shove" to knock him down, <i>"in order to provide something for the men to laugh at.<sup>2</sup></i>"<br><br> John Blackburn became the "jinny spinner" for <a href="p106.htm#i3170">Robert <span class="ns">Brearley</span></a> on 1 August 1840 at the Old Craft Mill, Clerk Green, <br> Weaving was a skill he had probably learnt from his father, for in the census of 6 June 1841 he was listed as a woollen weaver, living with his mother <a href="p2.htm#i64">Sarah <span class="ns">Blackburn</span></a>.<sup>3</sup><br><br> John tells of being out of work in 1842, and ready to throw his hand in with the discontented workers rioting and drawing the plugs from mill boilers.(the so-called Boiler-tapping Riots) He had been out of work for five weeks, then worked a month for 36s, so he tells:-<br><br> <i>"I found money to meet the tappers at Ravensthorpe, but they did not come till later. One of the men who had persuaded me away was to find money for the second day (as I had found it for the first), and David Brooke, of Clerk Green, next day. Jim P------- was also to find some; but no, no. He went instead and asked for my Jinny and work! I was on the road to Dewsbury to meet the boiler tappers, and Joe Hey, collier, of Carlinghow, my mate, was with me. As we were passing near Jim Redfearn's public-house, who was there but <a href="p106.htm#i3170">Robert <span class="ns">Brearley</span></a> and six or seven other masters. I expect they had been having a meeting, as Sam Brearley was one of them and <a href="p23.htm#i689">Henry <span class="ns">Hall</span></a> &#28;&#28;the old knurr and spell player , was another. Robert Brearley called out, 'John, whear sre ta going? Tappin' Ah expect! They're all at ther work but thee.' I said I couldn't believe it, but he said 'go and see.' It was the best argument I ever heard in all my life, and I left Joe Hey and went. We arranged that if they were at their work I should stop. They were there , right enough, and they laughed at me and threw all sorts of taunts. You see, I had no money, and I was depending on my friends paying me back what I had paid the first day; but, oh, no not a penny did I get!"<sup>2</sup></i><br><br> Tough times seem to have continued, for we also have a glimpse of a young John in some reminiscences, &#8220;Pioneers of the Textile Trade&#8221; published in the Batley news in 1909:-<br><br><i>&#8220;All the roads in Batley used to be repaired by covering the surface with a coating of broken dross, the refuse from the iron works. When, in wet weather, by frequent usage they had become very dirty, the dirt was scraped on to one side of the road and then thrown into small heaps and left for future use. The piles of dross, broken up into small pieces and ready for use and the lumps which had been brought from the iron works along with these cast up mounds at certain periods made Bradford Road as good as a Park for the pleasures which we used to derive from them....making enquiries about these days and where the dross came from I elicited the following information -"Well he wor a tall thin lad, dark complexioned. He worked for "Old Preston" at Carlinghow and he used to lead these drosses with a horse and cart from Farnley Iron Works. When he got back from there with a load and there was not time to go for a second load he had to work the day out with something else". "And who do you say the lad was" I enquired. "Why John Blackburn at t'owd</i> mill".<br><span style="font-size:8pt;">Farnley Iron Works were founded by the Armitage Family in 1844.<sup>4</sup></span><br><br> John Blackburn married <a href="#i50">Sarah <span class="ns">Preston</span></a>, daughter of <a href="p5.htm#i139">John <span class="ns">Preston</span></a> and <a href="p5.htm#i140">Martha <span class="ns">Marshall</span></a>, on 1 March 1846 at Batley.<sup>1</sup><br><br> It must have been at about this time that he set up in business as a flock dealer in a cottage house in Providence St  A few years later he built a warehouse opposite Providence Mills <br>He is said to have built up his capital by buying and selling surplus timbers from the construction of the Morley Railway tunnel. (under construction 1846-1848).<sup>2</sup><br> As a rag dealer in Providence Street in 1849 John Blackburn was among those listed as eligible to serve as Parish Constable, and we find similar listings for 1851 and 1852.<sup>5</sup> <br> In the census of 30 March 1851 he was listed as the head of household at Providence St, Batley, as a rag dealer employing 11 men.<sup>6</sup><br> He was one of the first members of the Batley Board of Health, which superceded the Board of Surveyors in 1853.<br> In the early 1850s John Blackburn built a house and warehouse in Bradford Rd, near the old Billy Well.  My illusration shows these premises, which do in fact still survive, but sadly altered from their original state; together with the Berlin business of which he became the owner during the 1850s.<a href="e90.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="collection V. E. Tomlinson"></a> <br>One who worked as foreman for John Blackburn in the 1850s was <a href="p98.htm#i2955">James <span class="ns">Colbeck</span></a>, who speaks of long working days at that time, finishing at seven or eight in evenings and four or five on Saturdays.<sup>7</sup> <br><br> <b><span style="font-size:13pt;">Making Shoddy in Berlin</span></b><br><br> John is said by Willans to have  joined an enterprise (a Shoddy Mill) in Berlin  set up by Mr Josh. Pyrah of Staincliffe,<i>"a master mason (so far as Batley is concerned"  </i><br> We are told that: "<i>He, with the assistance of Mr John Nussey, of Carlinghow Mills (a gentleman ever ready to help forward every thing that would tend to the welfare of the public) and Mr. Wharton, of Heckmondwike, fitted up machinery in Berlin for the pulling of shoddies from woollen rags.</i>"  It is likely that it was duties imposed on imported rags that turned the attention of these men to making Shoddy in Berlin.<sup>8,2</sup><br> This must refer to Mr. <a href="p31.htm#i938">John <span class="ns">Nussey</span></a> at White Lee House, Batley.<sup>9</sup> As to the Pyrah involved, Willans has the name  as Josh Pyrah and I spent some time looking through the Pyrahs to see who this might be, eventually coming up with a likely candidate. A <a href="p63.htm#i1908">Joseph <span class="ns">Pyrah</span></a> was listed in censuses as in the  rag trade at Staincliffe, but his stepfather Thomas Hepworth and brother Jeremiah Pyrah were stonemasons so he may well have had some knowledge of building trades. What made this seem the likelier was that he was John Blackburn's cousin, and could well have drawn him into the enterprise.<sup>9,10</sup> The involvement of <a href="p63.htm#i1908">Joseph <span class="ns">Pyrah</span></a> is borne out by the name J Pyrah which appears in a Berlin Directory for in 1855 at K&#246;penickerstrasse, Berlin.<sup>11</sup><br> Willans tells us that later John became the sole proprietor. Although he was not the founder it seems to be this business to which John's  obituary refers in saying <br><i>&#8220;In the early history of the shoddy trade, local manufacturers imported a large quantity from Germany, and a little short of half a century ago Mr Blackburn founded a Shoddy Manufactory at Berlin."<sup>9</sup> </i><br> He and <a href="p63.htm#i1908">Joseph <span class="ns">Pyrah</span></a> were both listed at in 1856 at K&#246;penickerstrasse as is F Wharton, "inhaber einer Minego und Shoddyfabrik."<sup>11</sup><br> <br><b><span style="font-size:13pt;">A comparable venture: Dodgshuns and Naylors at Wittenberge.</span></b><br><br>Another early venture in Germany seems to have had connections with the Batley area, for an account of the history of Wittenberge, on the Elbe, tells of a Shoddy manufacturing firm set up there by James Dodgshun, an English Merchant from Batley. Mr Dodgshun's brother-in-law, Joseph Naylor, is said to have taken over the works in 1859.<br>As with the enterprises with which John Blackburn was involved, initially the shoddy was sent to England, but later cloth manufacture was carried out there as well.<br> In fact Dodgshuns were a family from  Morley, but in business as wool merchants in Leeds.<sup>12,13</sup> <br>Other correspondents have ancestors who are known to have worked at Wittenberge, John Thomas Parr. believed to have been employed to set up/manage a department there, and Frederick Priestley, a master dyer.who became a Batley Alderman on his return.<sup>14,15,12</sup> <a href="p73.htm#i2188">Joseph <span class="ns">Parker</span></a>  was an described as an agent for Messrs Dodgson of Leeds and Morley.<sup>16</sup><br><br> By the late 1850s John Blackburn was living at Kirkham Cottage, East Ardsley.<a href="e27.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Kirkham Cottage   Photo by Brian Eley"></a> <br> On 11 November 1860 John Blackburn took on  <a href="p152.htm#i4487">Jack <span class="ns">Wood</span></a> as a farmer lad.  See Jack's details for an interesting account of his career.<br> In the census of 7 April 1861 he was listed as the head of household at Kirkham Cottage, East Ardsley, as a farmer and shoddy dealer on 32 acres of land.<sup>17</sup><br> John Blackburn was said to have at one time owned Carlinghow New Hall, Batley perhaps by 1861 when we find his mother-in-law <a href="p5.htm#i140">Martha <span class="ns">Preston</span></a> living there.<a href="e58.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a> <br><br><span style="font-size:13pt;"><b>Acquisition of the Old Mill.</b></span><br><br>The Old Mill at Batley , originally built around 1796 and run by a company of small manufacturers, had passed into the hands of Messrs M. Sheard and Sons, who put it up for sale by auction in Dewsbury in 1862.<sup>18</sup>   My illustration shows the mill on an early twentieth century billhead, but seems to correspond closely to earlier plans.<a href="e77.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="collection V. E. Tomlinson"></a> <br>In the following year John purchased the nearby <b>Havercroft Mill.</b> <br> <br><br> In 1864 John Blackburn was listed as resident at at Lamplands, Batley, presumably at  Field House, the building of which is said to have been begun by a Mr Husbands, but which he completed.<sup>19</sup><br>  In 1866 John Blackburn mortgaged his property at Kirkham Gate and Havercroft Mill in Batley to <a href="p142.htm#i4214">John Beswicke <span class="ns">Greenwood</span></a> for &#163;2000.  <a href="e55.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="photo &#169; V E Tomlinson 2007 of document in collection of V. E. Tomlinson"></a> <br><br>Another move in England took him away from Batley again, for he was listed as the head of household in the 2 April 1871 census at the Red House, Wentbridge, Kirk Smeaton, as a Merchant, employing a governess, Mary Ward Dawson, for his children.<sup>20</sup><br><br> His obituary implies that John Blackburn had for some time been having problems with his health, and that this was a reason for his moves. However, when in good form he was very fond of hunting. We are told that he went with various hunts including the Badsworth, and Wentbridge was in the heart of Badsworth country, so I have wondered if that was a reason for that locale.<br><br> In about 1875 another mill was purchased by John.<br><br> <span style="font-size:13pt;"><b>The Mill at K&#246;penick</b></span><br><br> He preferred the role of entrepreneur that of "hands on" manager, and soon there was another venture. He was the purchaser of a mill at K&#246;penick, Berlin which had previously belonged to the Blakeley family, and he must have purchased this from &#28;&#28; <a href="p51.htm#i1488">Edward <span class="ns">Blakeley</span></a> and <a href="p78.htm#i2383">James Henry <span class="ns">Blakeley</span></a> An exciting episode in my researches was to find a few years ago that the buildings of this mill still existed. An enquiry at a local museum as to whether anything was known of an English-owned mill was met by the response, <i>"was the name Blackburn?" </i>We were given copies of some documentation concerning the building, and were about to leave when we were asked, <i>"Don't you want to see it?" </i> <br>We found the mill buildings only a short walk away. Although decrepit the premises were in some fashion in use, and we were only able to see them from one side.but were able to form an impression that substantial parts of the original buildings survived .As, alas, happens on these occasions, we had had some camera crisis, and only had a disposable one, so my photos are poor. but the central one shows our initial view, and by the chimney can just be discerned the pitched roof of a brick built building which I suspect must be the earliest part. We were only able to look at the right hand side of the buildings, where my other views were taken, but again there is an edifice of early brick. The windows have been much altered but again there is a pitched roof, and I wonder if this might once have been the house where Benjamin Blakeley lived.<sup>2</sup><a href="e97.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a> <br> In 1879  a drying room was installed and a furher building was added to the K&#246;penick establishment.<sup>21</sup> <br> <br><span style="font-size:13pt;"><b>The Mill at Sch&#246;neweide</b></span><br><br> John Blackburn established a woollen cloth factory at Sch&#246;neweide, Berlin, by 1879. This was in an area newly being developed on the left bank of the Spree, indeed a family member spoke of unmade roads at first.  John is said to have been a member of the first district council there, along with other industrialists willing to invest in the area, including Louis Kunheim who had a chemical factory.  In 1878 this area became a separate municipality with the name of Niedersch&#246;nweide, and a school was built the following year. Another woollen factory, Anton Lehmann's, followed in 1881. <br> Hundreds of Batley people are said to have left their native town and found very remunerative employment there. The Blackburn mill  mill has gone, but we have a record of its name.<sup>2</sup><a href="e88.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="collection V. E. Tomlinson"></a> <br>The presentation by the workpeople of a musical box to John Blackburn's son <a href="p2.htm#i56">Isaac</a> on 18 November 1879 for his twenty-first birthday suggests that the mill was in production at this time.<sup>22</sup><br><br> <b><span style="font-size:13pt;">A West Riding Colony in Berlin</span></b><br><br>By this time there was quite a substantial Yorkshire colony in Berlin, with Yorkshire men working not only for John Blackburn but for Lehmanns, a firm close by the Blackburn mill. A correspondent to the Leeds Mercury in 1885 speaks of discovering this English presence in what were then still villages amongst wooded countryside, Johannisthal and Niedersch&#246;nweide. Our correspondent made his way from Johannisthal station, but it was to the latter place that he was directed, and to a settlement of some two hundred Yorkshire folk. He speaks of two flourishing factories managed by the English, John Blackburn's and also Lehmann's, though the latter is a German name. It is said that when the factories started there were two trains a day from Berlin, but now, only a few years later, there are fifteen and the station is being enlarged.<br>Our correspondent gives this colony a definite character, Liberal in politics and supporters of Gladstone; and musical, most had pianos. (One might think this is something they shared with the Germans, but we are told that in Weimar anyone playing the piano with the street window open was subject to a fine of several marks!)<br>Education was at the village school, the <i>Gemeinde-Schule, </i>but English was spoken at home and at Sunday School, so the children there would have had the advantage of being bi-lingual.Though various denominations were represented, there seems to have ben but one Sunday School, and this ties in splendidly with information sent by Mike Whitehead, for his ancestor Frederick Priestley, a former superintendant of Cross Bank Sunday School in Batley, was one of the founders, and superintendant, of the German Sunday School for fourteen years.<br>We are told that Batley Feast was celebrated. More impressive still, perhaps, were later festivities for Queen Victoria's Jubilees in 1887 and 1897, where Mr Priestley was secretary for the children's celebrations.<sup>23,12</sup> <br><br> In the census of 3 April 1881 John Blackburn was listed as the head of household at Rose Bank, Valley Road, Scarborough, as a Woollen Merchant.<sup>24</sup><br><br> Other skilled men were attracted by the opportunities of working in Germany, and we learn from an account in the Batley News on 23 August 1884 that <a href="p258.htm#i7261">Edward <span class="ns">Bailey</span></a> had earlier that year left his former employ at Victoria Mills in Carlinghow to work for John Blackburn, but was injured when falling down a boiler flue during work being carried on at the Niedersch&#246;nweide mill.<sup>4</sup><br><br>  In 1890 John Blackburn was listed as a shoddy manufacturer resident  at Rose Bank, Valley Road, Scarborough.<sup>25</sup><br> In the early eighteen-nineties John Blackburn sold the Berlin and Coepnick businesses to Mr <a href="p2.htm#i71">Charles <span class="ns">Blackburn</span></a>, one of his brothers and <a href="p112.htm#i3326">Mark <span class="ns">Blackburn</span></a> his nephew.<br> He was listed as the head of household in the 5 April 1891 census at The Beeches, Lancaster Road, Bilton, Harrogate, a Shoddy Merchant, unaccompanied by other family members, but with a coachman and housekeeper. It isn't clear whether he spent much time there, for he retained the house in Scarborough.<sup>26</sup><br><br> John was still taking an active interest in business opportunities in Germany, for in in 1892  he purchased a brickworks with clay pit in Miersdorf, close to Zeuthen and about fourteen miles south-east of Berlin.<sup>27</sup> <br>  In 1895 Sarah, John's wife of 49 years, died in Scarborough. <br> By this time health problems were an issue forJohn. His obituary tells us:- <br><i>"He was always ailing, and when he went to Scarborough he spent most of his time in a specially constructed conservatory, which was kept at a uniform temperature in all seasons of the year. In all, he sought the advice of between 30 and 40 doctors, including the Emperor of Germany's medical attendant, and he tabulated the opinions which these gentlemen expressed from time to time. "You will not live for more than three months, Mr. Blackburn," one doctor told him; another, more optimistic, thought he might survive half a year. Mr Blackburn often recalled these comfortless words in his later years, and with grim humour added, "but nearly all the doctors themselves are gone, and i am left."<sup>2</sup><br></i><br>  Circa 1897 John Blackburn sold the mill at Sch&#246;neweide to a Mr Miller for &#163;70,000.<br> German records show that it was in 1897 that ownership of the German brickworks was transferred to his son <a href="p2.htm#i56">Isaac <span class="ns">Blackburn</span></a>.<sup>28</sup><br> John Blackburn made a will on 31 December 1897.<br> It may have been because of health considerations that John became the owner of a house near Ventnor, on the Isle of Wight, described as a charming residence commanding an uninterrupted view of the sea.<sup>2</sup><a href="e59.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a> <br>John Blackburn died on 8 December 1900 at Ventnor, Isle of Wight, at age 79  (an unknown value). John Blackburn's coffin was carried by Old Mill staff including <a href="p109.htm#i3227">George Sheard <span class="ns">Fox</span></a>.<sup>2</sup><br><br> John Blackburn was buried on 11 December 1900 at the Cemetery, Batley, The funeral was attended by the Mayor and members of the Corporation, Magistrates and what were described as the leading gentry of the district. John's house in Bradford Road, Batley, known as "The Red House", was later to be my father <a href="#i1">Brian <span class="ns">Eley</span>'s</a> childhood home.</div>

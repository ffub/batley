      <div id="contentw"><div id="content"><h1>Batley Cotton</h1><p><span style="font-size: medium;">We think of Yorkshire wool and Lancashire cotton, but cotton cloth was also produced in Yorkshire in the early years of the nineteeth century, whilst later cotton came to be much used for warps with woollen weft.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><a href="">James Willans</a>, speaking of Batley at the beginning of the 19th century says:-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-size: small;"><em>"Cotton weaving constituted the chief employment of the female portion of the inhabitants at this period by hand looms, the warps being sent down from Lancashire by manufacturers who distributed them to the weavers and supplied the woof or weft as well; also taking them when woven and paying for the weaving, and sending the woven pieces to the owners, when they were got ready for the merchants".</em> <sup>1</sup></span></span></p>
</span>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Some cotton was spun locally, as well as woven locallyand </span><a href="p98.htm#i2955"><span style="font-size: medium;">James Colbeck</span></a><span style="font-size: medium;"> told of his father, </span><a href="p70.htm#i2119"><span style="font-size: medium;">Joseph</span></a><span style="font-size: medium;">, a manager at <strong>Birkenshaw Bottoms Mills</strong>, travelling about the district putting out cotton warps and taking in orders for pieces. This was probably the firm of <strong>Abraham Sharp &amp; Co</strong>, listed by Baines as cotton spinners and manufacturers. In 1828 Abraham Sharp of Birkenshaw Bottoms and Cannon Street Manchester, in partnership with a Samuel and James Sharp, cotton spinners and manufacturers, was insolvent. </span></p>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Joseph Colbeck left Birkenshaw Mills and began hand loom weaving. He is said to have employed several women as weavers, selling the unbleached cotton pieces in Dewsbury market place. James fetched cotton weft for him for a firm in Gawthorpe, <strong>Hansons</strong>. In the Leeds Mercury in 1816 we find that a notice of sale of w</span><span style="font-size: medium;">oollen machinery from this mill, stating that the firm was in future to be wholly employed in cotton. <span style="font-size: small;"><sup>2</sup></span> It may be the same Hanson who bought cotton spinning machinery from the firm of <strong>Hague, Cook and Wormald</strong> in Dewsbury in 1821.</span></p>
<p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Whilst woollen weaving was proscribed for women, master weavers still being required to serve an apprenticeship, cotton, probably in narrower widths, bypassed these rules, and some was done by less well-paid women, somthing which we do not see with woollens in Batley until the introduction of the power loom</span>.</span></span></p>
<p> <span style="font-size: x-small;"><em><span style="font-size: small;">We find a few references to cotton spinning in Batley, and the 1807 poll book lists <a href="p28.htm#i852">William Woffenden</a><a></a> as a cotton manufacturer there.</span></em></span></p>
</p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><em><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><em><span style="font-size: small;"> I<span style="font-size: medium;">n 1802 an article said:-</span></span></em></span></span></em></span>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: #333333;"><em>The rapid increase of Cotton Manufactories in the North of England has lately been almost incredible. Lancashire is, and perhaps will continue to be the grand centre; but one manufactory of this article has, within the last four or five years, been gaining much ground in Cheshire, Staffordshire and Westmoreland,; and so considerable has its progress been in Yorkshire, that the labouring poor in the western parts of that Riding are at present principally employed in it. In the neighbourhood of Halifax, Huddersfield, Bradford and even Dewsbury several large manufactories have lately been erected, and we are informed the proprietors of these works have the most flattering prospects of success</em> <sup>3</sup></span></span></p>

He was the son of <a href="#i488">Abraham <span class="ns">Binns</span></a> and <a href="p18.htm#i523">Sarah <span class="ns">Mortimer</span></a>. Isaac Binns was baptized on 15 December 1844 at Birstall.<sup>1</sup><br><br> He appeared as a  scholar on the census of 30 March 1851 in the household of <a href="#i488">Abraham <span class="ns">Binns</span></a> and <a href="p18.htm#i523">Sarah <span class="ns">Binns</span></a> at Birkenshaw.<sup>2</sup> Isaac Binns was educated  at various schools, with perhaps  some first lessons in Birkenshaw. In his own writings he mentions four schools, Ben Preston's <i>( a Benjamin Preston is listed as a schoolmaster in the 1841 Batley census)</i>, a Methodist Day and Sunday school kept by Mr Hepplestone, the Grammar School, and the Wesleyan Day school kept by Mr. John Osborne. His obituary only mentions John Osborne's school, and it was there that he stayed on as a pupil teacher. We are told that although he passed his examinations early,<i>"the scholastic profession was not adapted to one of so lively a temperament."</i> <br><br> In that his book was originally a series of articles for the local paper which would have been read by friends and former schoolmates I see no reason for him to have given a false account. If he attended the Grammar School for a time, it may have been that his family could not afford to keep him there. His father died when he was thirteen, and this may have been preceded by a period of ill health.  Isaac Binns was a half-timer at Bromley's mill, probably only a lad of twelve or so, and would have been able to contribute a shilling or two to the family income whilst still attending school for part of the day.<br> <br> On leaving Mr Osborne's he found employment as a cashier at Messrs. Ward's provision merchants in Leeds.<br><br> In the census of 7 April 1861 he was listed as a scholar aged 16 the son of <a href="p18.htm#i523">Sarah <span class="ns">Binns</span></a> at Soothill Lane, Soothill.<sup>3</sup> <br> Isaac Binns married <a href="#i464">Sarah Thurman <span class="ns">Robinson</span></a>, daughter of <a href="p19.htm#i586">John <span class="ns">Robinson</span></a> and <a href="p19.htm#i587">Grace <span class="ns">Stubley</span></a>, on 15 April 1868 at Wesleyan Chapel, Batley, by licence. He was described as a bookkeeeper on the marriage certificate.<sup>4</sup><br><br> In the census of 2 April 1871 he was listed as a secretary in a woollen mill visiting his mother-in-law <a href="p19.htm#i587">Grace <span class="ns">Robinson</span></a>.<sup>5</sup><br><br> <span style="font-size:13pt;"> Isaac Binns; Dialect Author and editor</span><br><br> It was probably during the 1860s that became involved in the production of dialect almanacs which were something of a fashion at the time. The first of these seems to have been by Charles Rogers of Barnsley, who wrote under the pseudonym of "Tom Treddlehoyle" and whose Pogmoor Almenac first came out in 1843. Later the fashion spread to Batley.<sup>6</sup><br>  Isaac Binns was not the only Batley man to engage in writing these Almanacs, <a href="p69.htm#i2070">Abraham <span class="ns">Lister</span></a> was another.<br> One of his earlier ventures in dialect writing seems to have been <b>"Tom Wallop"</b> a humorous account of his experiences in the Birstall Rifle Brigade.<a href="e70.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="&#169;   Image courtesy of Miss M Binns"></a> If the Rifle Brigade's exploits were taken a little more seriously than those Isaac describes, there was sometimes, as at one encampment at which <a href="p3.htm#i80">Benjamin <span class="ns">Sheard</span></a> was present with the Batley Brigade, an element of farce.<br>  Isaac Binns was to produce his own dialect almanacs and similar writings, including:-<br><br> <b>"T Bag o'Shoddy "</b> written under the pseudonym of Uriah Wakatea. This is said to have been published by various publishers, and 1872 is said to have been the fourth year of publication.  <br><b>"T'Coddy Miln"</b> or more fully <b>"T'Owd Original Coddy Miln Almanac"</b> published by Senior of Heckmondwike.<br><b>"Heckmondwike Swashland Almanac" </b>published by Senior of Heckmondwike<br><br>His  obituary in the Batley News tells us of his editing other Almanacs, "Country Words", "T' Barnsla Foaks" and "Tommy Toddles" Almanacs, and writing serial stories including "Outlines and Notes,"  "On the Line" "The Argonaut", "At the Last Victory" and "Fanny the Orphan" and "After Fifteen Years".<sup>7</sup> <br> Following the death of Charles Rodgers in 1874 he was to take on the role of "Tom Treddlehoyle" in editing the Pogmoor Almenac.<br><br> <span style="font-size:13pt;"><b>Borough Accountant</b></span><br><br> in October 1874 Isaac Binns was appointed Borough Accountant, succeeding <a href="p140.htm#i4186">Robert <span class="ns">Shackleton</span></a>, in which position he was to serve until his death.<sup>8</sup><i> </i>  Isaac Binns was <i>The post was advertised at a salary of &#163;120 pa, but in 1876 it was increased to &#163;150, in return for which Isaac appears top have agreed to remain in post for at least two years. (There may well have been further increments; his successor was awarded a salary of &#163;200 per annum on his appointment in September 1884).<sup>9,10</sup></i> <br> In 1874 the council had purchased the building built as a mechanic's institute and public hall for use as Town Hall, and there were discussions about extendng this, but in view of heavy financial committments at the time it was decided that there would be only minor alterations to improve office accommodation. These, carried out in 1876, provided better accommodation for Isaac and an assistant. <br> Isaac seems to have tackled the isues involved in Local Authority finance with enthusiastic interest, and wrote a pamphlet on the use of Sinking Funds to finance Public Works, in the form of a letter addressed to Alderman Fox. Another booklet is a series of Loans Repayment and Annuity tables for use by other accountants.<a href="e9.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="&#169; collection V. E. Tomlinson"></a>  On 1 March 1881 Isaac Binns and <a href="p3.htm#i81">Michael <span class="ns">Sheard</span></a> were, with fifteen others, founder members of the Batley Antiquarian Society which met at the Princess Alice Coffee House in Wilton Street, Batley, &#28;&#28; Sadly this was a short-lived Society, several of the early members dying in the next few years.<br><br>  Isaac Binns must have had a wide circle of friends and correspondents, and among these was <a href="p161.htm#i4731">George Markham <span class="ns">Tweddell</span></a> , the Cleveland author, whose wife Elizabeth also wrote dialect works under her maiden name of Elizabeth Cole. George and Elizabeth were also strong supporters of a movement to improve conditions among the poor by giving them wider educational opportunities. This they put into practice by moving to Bury, where George became Head of a new Industrial School, and Elizabeth its Matron.  On the closure of the school they returned to Cleveland, but with a growing family the 1870s saw a period of financial hardship and Isaac was one of the contributors to a "Purse of Gold" raised by George's friends to assist him.<sup>11</sup><br>  In November 1881 Isaac Binns received a letter from <a href="p161.htm#i4731">George</a> with a biography of his wife, Elizabeth, whose work Isaac must have been interested in publishing.<a href="e108.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="&#169; collection V E tomlinson"></a> <br><br><span style="font-size:13pt;"><b>From Village to Town</b></span> <br><br> in 1882 came the publication of Isaac's book,<b><i> </i></b><i>"From Village to Town"</i><b>, </b>subtitled,<b><i>"</i></b><i>A series of Random Reminiscences of Batley during the last 30 years."  </i><br>The book betrays its origins as a series of newspaper articles, but, although partly written in a comic vein,  tells us much about how our ancestors lived, worked, ate and even amused themselves. Isaac's anecdotes give us information about various characters mentioned elsewhere on this site including <a href="p41.htm#i1225">James <span class="ns">Thurman</span></a>, <a href="p23.htm#i699">Robert <span class="ns">Brearley</span></a>, <a href="p69.htm#i2070">Abraham <span class="ns">Lister</span></a>, <a href="p7.htm#i208">John <span class="ns">Ward</span></a> and <a href="p197.htm#i5650">Catherine <span class="ns">Exley</span></a>.<sup>12</sup><br> Speaking of the unpaved, rutted, muddy roads of the Batley of his youth, he ascribes to <a href="p142.htm#i4214">John Beswicke <span class="ns">Greenwood</span></a> , old "Beswick" as he calls him, the epithet of <i>"mucky Batley."<sup>12</sup></i> Isaac Binns told of sitting in on Council Proceedings, and gave some account of the first Mayor, <a href="p75.htm#i2238">John <span class="ns">Jubb</span></a>.<sup>12</sup><br> Isaac was cousin to <a href="p161.htm#i4736">Lizzie <span class="ns">Stehr</span></a> and I was charmed to hear from Jeannie Muller that her copy of <i>"From Village to Town"</i> was one that he gave to Lizzie.<sup>13</sup><a href="e109.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a> <br><br> Isaac Binns was a man of many interests, and a Fellow of the Royal Historical, English Dialect, Folk Lore; Yorkshire Archeological and Topographical societies. He is also said to have played an initiatory part in the formation of the Heckmondwike and Batley Naturalist Societies. <br> He is said to have caught a chill on a visit to Ingleborough, a favourite spot, on Good Friday and died on 6 August 1884 aged 39, the age at which his father had died. He was buried on 9 August 1884 at the Cemetery, Batley, following a service in Purlwell Wesleyan Chapel.<a href="e10.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="&#169; collection V. E. Tomlinson"></a> <br>Obituaries brought tributes from friends, and in one a correspondent from abroad writes:-<br><br><i>"I was deeply grieved to read in your columns of the death of Mr Isaac Binns F.R.H.S.  He was a man of culture, remarkable perception and brilliant talents. Though I believe his aquaintance with the classics was but of a limited extent, he possessed a very extensive knowledge of modern literature, and wrote pretty extensively in various directions. He deeply loved historical and archeological research, and was an ardent student of folk-lore. He was one of the best arithmeticians I ever knew, and I believe he could add up a column of figures, consisting of pounds, shillings and pence, all at the same time. But it was not merely in the working of accounts that he excelled, for perhaps he was one of the best financiers in the district. His knowledge of the general bearings of financial operations rank him as a thoroughly political economist. I never knew him take much interest in the political world; he preferred to rest in those calmer realms which are more congenial to a thoughtful student. He was a keen obsever of men and manners, and described his experiences in a 'racy' and interesting style, and many will miss the cheery welcome voice and mourn for the dear good fellow, who has left us for a happier country. He was not one of your morose students, who wouldn't enter into the pursuits of other men, but would set off with two or three companions and tramp 20 or 25 miles across the moors. He was a follower of Isaac Walton and often walked long distances with his line and rod. He liked sport, and whenever he shot at a bird or aimed at a target he was generally about the mark. He was one of the most energetic founders of the Birstall Rifle Corps, and to the last he remained an honorary member of the Batley movement. He was a respected member of the Order of Foresters, also an Oddfellow and a member of other societies. His kind disposition left many with happy memories of his</i> perso<i>nality.</i>"<br><br> Another obituary brought a poem, which can be seen by clicking on the icon here.<sup>14</sup><a href="e81.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="collection V.

Deeds of 1796 describe that at Clerk Green as "lately erected" whilst the Old Mill appears to have been still in the planning stages</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #666699;"> </span><span style="font-size: medium;">Again it was a Company mill, a group of 23 men putting up money for the venture, the names of the original subscribers being:-</span></p>

</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">The original trustees in a deed of 1796 were:-</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #666699;"><span style="font-size: small;"><em>William Blakeley<br />Thomas Dean<br />John Cooper<br /></em></span></span><a href="p205.htm#i5859"><span style="font-size: small;"><em><span style="font-size: small;">John Scatcherd</span></em></span></a><br /><span style="color: #666699;"><span style="font-size: small;"><em><span style="font-size: small;">Joseph Greenfield<br />John Chadwick<br />Thomas Parr</span></em></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #666699;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="color: #000000;">Operation as a Company Mill</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Over time there were changes in the trustees; for instance in 1813 William Ibbetson,John Wilson and Joseph Senior replaced John Cooper and John Chadwick, who had died, and Thomas Parr who had resigned and sold up, as trustees. In 1825 </span><a href="p23.htm#i680"><span style="font-size: medium;">Thomas Hall</span></a><span style="font-size: medium;">, Joseph Lee and Thomas Wilby replaced Messrs Greenfield, Scatcherd and Wilson. </span><span style="font-size: medium;">It appears that the mill was operated in the early years by <strong>Messrs John Scatcherd &amp; Co</strong>, for in 1833 the Leeds Mercury reported the death of a Joseph Clarkson who had been for upwards of 30 years bookkeeper to Messrs.John Scatcherd &amp; Co. of the Old Mill. John Scatcherd himself died in the previous year and his shares in the mill were put up for sale. Interestingly his will mentions a colliery worked by the proprietors of the mill.</span></p>
<p><a href="p70.htm#i2119">Joseph Colbeck</a> was a spinner there in his youth, while young <a href="p35.htm#i1042">George</a> and <a href="p33.htm#i983">James</a> Stubley were working there in the 1830s as piecers.</p>
<p>
<p>A deed of 1835 in which Joseph Senior is bought out by the other proprietors refers to the Mill as in the possession of <strong>Messrs.</strong> <strong>Hall, Sheard and Company</strong>, a firm listed in an 1842 Directory as scribbling and fulling millers.</p>
</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">By 1846, when a share was offered for sale, the mill was in the occupation of<strong> Messrs </strong></span><a href="p205.htm#i5870"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Thomas Wilby</strong></span></a><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong> &amp;Co</strong>, and they are listed there as woollen manufacturers in an 1855 directory.However, a deed of 15th October 1851, a mortgage from Samuel Burnley to John Burnley of &pound;150 on security of one thirty-sixth part of the Old Mill refers to it as now in the possession of Messrs Michael Sheard and Sons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">In 1858, a directory listing shows<strong> </strong></span><a href="p2.htm#i75"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Michael Sheard </strong></span></a><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>&amp; Sons</strong> as scribbling and fulling millers there, as well as at Valley Mills. It was Michael Sheard and Sons who were described as in occupation when the mill was offered for sale early in 1862, described as a woollen mill with steam engine, fulling stocks, scribbling, carding and spinning machines, dyehouse and drying room, warehouses and other buildings. There was extra building land, and the proximity to the Railway Station was highlighted.</span></p>

<div id="ui103" class="spi spileft" style="width:500px;"><img alt="" src="My billhead bigger half.jpg" width="500" height="330"><div class="spic">© image collection V E Tomlinson</div></div><div id="ui104" class="spi spiright" style="width:125px;"><img alt="" src="John Blackburn trademark.JPG" width="125" height="125"></div><p><strong><span style="font-size: large;">John Blackburn: Old Mill</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">By May of 1862 </span><a href="p1.htm#i49"><span style="font-size: medium;">John Blackburn</span></a><span style="font-size: medium;"> was in possession and selling the existing machinery explicitly to make room for the Mungo, Shoddy and Flock business.  John already had a business in Germany and was to acquire another, and in these early days large amounts of pulled shoddy and mungo is said to have been imported under his trademark J.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">John must have installed equipment of his own, but perhaps started modestly, or was concentrating on importing, for an account of </span><a href="p286.htm#i7982"><span style="font-size: medium;">Ned Wilson</span></a><span style="font-size: medium;"> who worked there from the beginning says that there was only one rag machine at first of which he was placed in charge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Considerable damage was done by a major fire late on May 9th 1871. The fire was discovered by policemen on duty in the area, and the alarm was raised. The two Batley fire engines were quickly on the scene, joined soon by several other brigades. Unfortunately water was in short supply, as was said to then frequently happen in such cases, being turned off at the street mains. It was a long while before the firemen were able to access a sufficient supply and the fire quickly took hold. A three storey building forty yards long is said to have been burnt to the ground, Damage estimated at around &pound;20,000 is said to have been covered by insurance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Whilst the German mills later passed into the hands of his John's brother and nephew, the Batley mill was rebuilt and was long to remain in Blackburn hands. </span><span style="font-size: medium;">For a time John's nephew </span><a href="p43.htm#i1273"><span style="font-size: medium;">George</span></a><span style="font-size: medium;"> was involved along with his son </span><a href="p1.htm#i38"><span style="font-size: medium;">John William</span></a><span style="font-size: medium;"> and George's son </span><a href="p86.htm#i2606"><span style="font-size: medium;">William Henry</span></a><span style="font-size: medium;">, but in 1892 George and his son left to set up in business on their own in Birstall, and John William was in charge until his retirement in the early 1920s, to be succeeded by his sons </span><a href="p1.htm#i40"><span style="font-size: medium;">John Sheard Blackburn</span></a><span style="font-size: medium;"> and </span><a href="p1.htm#i45"><span style="font-size: medium;">Frederick Blackburn</span></a><span style="font-size: medium;">. though this partnership was dissolved on the 24th of July 1924,when Fred left to start his own venture in Ravensthorpe, where my father </span><a href="p1.htm#i1"><span style="font-size: medium;">Brian Eley</span></a><span style="font-size: medium;"> was to join him. Eventually with John Sheard Blackburn's withdrawal, The Old Mill was sold, but continued as an active concern for some time, finally closing in 1971.</span></p>

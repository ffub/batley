<div class="narr"><div class="pid" style="width: 150px;"><img alt="" width="150" height="225" title="" src="ben_sheard.jpg" ></div>     Benjamin <span class="ns">Sheard</span> was born on 13 January 1831. He was the son of <a href="p2.htm#i75">Michael <span class="ns">Sheard</span></a> and <a href="p2.htm#i76">Sarah <span class="ns">Newsome</span></a>. Benjamin Sheard was baptized on 6 February 1831 at Batley.<sup>1</sup><br> In the census of 6 June 1841 he was listed as the son of <a href="p2.htm#i75">Michael <span class="ns">Sheard</span></a> at Havercroft, Batley.<sup>2</sup> <br> In the census of 30 March 1851 he was listed as aged 20, an assistant, presumably to his father <a href="p2.htm#i75">Michael <span class="ns">Sheard</span></a>.<sup>3</sup><br><br> Benjamin Sheard married <a href="p40.htm#i1189">Mary <span class="ns">Senior</span></a>, daughter of <a href="p90.htm#i2718">Benjamin <span class="ns">Senior</span></a> and <a href="p81.htm#i2445">Elizabeth <span class="ns">Talbot</span></a>, on 11 September 1856 at the Parish Church, Batley.<sup>4,5</sup> <br><br> In the census of 7 April 1861 he was listed as the head of household at Wellington St, Batley, as a woollen cloth manufacturer, but by 1864 was listed as living at Upper Batley.<sup>6,7</sup><br><br> Benjamin Sheard is said to have suggested the provision of new materials for the facade of Zion Chapel and contributed to its funding along with his father-in-law <a href="p90.htm#i2718">Benjamin <span class="ns">Senior</span></a>.<sup>8</sup><br><br> <span style="font-size:13pt;"><b>Batley Rifle Volunteers</b></span><br> in 1866 Benjamin Sheard was one of the founders of the Batley Rifle Volunteers, the 43rd West Riding Corps, and from 1868 was the first Captain Commandant of the detachment, said to have been linked with the Wakefield Battalion.  Later promotions were to give him the ranks of major and eventually of lieutenant-colonel in command of the Battalion.<sup>9</sup><br><br> By 1867 Benjamin Sheard was living at Elmwood House, where a tower was added from which he is said to have observed his volunteers drilling. <a href="e267.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="&#169; image courtesy of Batley Community Archive"></a> <br>In the census of 2 April 1871 he was listed as the head of household at Elmwood House, Batley, as Captn 43 West Yorkshire Rifle Volunteers, Woollen manufacturer. By now Benjamin (listed in census as Bn) is employing a coachman, governess, cook, nurse and general servant.<sup>10</sup><br> It was around this time that Benjamin Sheard became a director of the West Riding Union Bank.<br><br> If his Rifle Brigade exploits were not quite as comical as those portrayed by <a href="p16.htm#i463">Isaac <span class="ns">Binns</span></a> there were occasional elements of farce.  In 1873 the Rifle Volunteers joined a Battalion camp at Scarborough Castle.  They travelled to Scarborough on the Saturday afternoon, marched through the town and pitched their tents.  Then we hear:- <br><br><i>"about seven p.m. on Saturday there were appearances of a storm coming on, and by half past eight it rained heavily; a heavy wind from the north accompnying it, rendered outdoor quarters anything but comfortable. This continued all through the night. Such a storm had not prevailed in Scarbro' for a long time past. Some of the tents are very bad indeed, and the consequence was that the rain beat through the canvas something like a wave, and the men could get no sleep. Some of them paraded the camp the whole of the night, and had a rather lively experience of the hardships of the soldier's life. One third of the beds were wet, and fires were kindled in the barracks to dry them, and by four o'clock in the afternoon of Sunday  the camp assumed its ordinary vivacity and life. Notwithstanding their first night's experience under canvas, on Saturday morning the men appeared little worse for the severe test to which they had beenput, and related to each other various incidents of the rough night's experience, some of which were very ludicrous, one of the men, for instance, saying that he should have slept soundly but for the fact that a gentle stream of water would persist in trickling on his fgace whatever position he took up, another fellow ran about the castle yard with nothing on but his drawers, saying he did it to keep up the circulation after his shower bath."</i><br><br>It was on this occasion that Benjamin was promoted to major, later to be further promoted to Colonel.<sup>11</sup> <br> A Drill Hall was built in Bradford Road in 1870 to the designs of architects <a href="#i81">Michael <span class="ns">Sheard</span></a>, Benjamin's brother, and <a href="p10.htm#i272">Walter <span class="ns">Hanstock</span></a>. <br>His first wife Mary having died in 1877, Benjamin Sheard married <a href="p10.htm#i274">Annie <span class="ns">Talbot</span></a>, daughter of <a href="p1.htm#i10">Joseph <span class="ns">Talbot</span></a> and <a href="p40.htm#i1197">Ann <span class="ns">Walker</span></a>,on 5 December 1878.<sup>1</sup> In the census of 3 April 1881 he was listed as the head of household at Elmwood House, Batley, as a woollen manufacturer.<sup>12</sup><br> Benjamin Sheard was a Borough Magistrate and in 1882 was elected to the West Riding bench.<br> In the census of 5 April 1891 he was listed as the head of household at Elmwood House, Batley, as a woollen manufacturer and magistrate. By now Benjamin is employing a cook, sewing maid, two housemaids, and a coachman and family in the lodge.<sup>13</sup><br> He died on 30 April 1891 at age 60.<br> He was buried on 1 May 1891 at the cemetery, Batley.</div>

<div class="narr">     Michael <span class="ns">Sheard</span> was born in 1833. He was the son of <a href="p2.htm#i75">Michael <span class="ns">Sheard</span></a> and <a href="p2.htm#i76">Sarah <span class="ns">Newsome</span></a>. Michael Sheard was baptized on 17 March 1833 at Batley.<br> In the census of 6 June 1841 he was listed as the son of <a href="p2.htm#i75">Michael <span class="ns">Sheard</span></a>.<sup>1</sup> <br> <br>It must early have been decided that the woollen trade was not for him, and his interests lay rather in architecture and civil engineering. According to his obituary "he was articled to a firm in Bradford, and when quite a young man gave up his articles to come to Batley." Not all his training seems to have been in Bradford, however, for he is listed below as the pupil of a Mr Clapham of Wakefield. The only likely Mr Clapham I can find does indeed seem very likely:-<br><i>The 1851 census for Wakefield shows a Charles Clapham, a Civil Engineer and Surveyor, living in Northgate with his wife and four children and keeping four servants.By 1861 the family have moved to what would have been an elegant address in St. John's Square, but Charles has died, and we note that in 1865 Michael refers to him as the late Mr. Clapham.<sup>2</sup></i><br> <i>(The plan of a St. Mary's Church, Wakefield may well by by this Charles. Although described as surveyor and civil engineer it would not have been by any means unusual for such a person to combine this with architecture).<sup>3</sup></i><br><br> In the census of 30 March 1851 Michael Sheard was listed as apprentice Civil Engineer, the son of <a href="p2.htm#i75">Michael <span class="ns">Sheard</span></a>.<sup>4</sup><br><br> <b><span style="font-size:13pt;">Batley Town Hall</span></b><br><br>Michael Sheard  is thought to have quitted his training at about this time when he was entrusted with the design of a Public Hall which was to be built by a company of shareholders. This served at first as a Mechanics' Institute and venue for many functions. Only later did it become the Town Hall. 1868 saw the incorporation of Batley as a Borough, and someCouncil  meetings were held there, but in 1873 Councillor Marriott suggested that in view of the lack of dedicated accommodation for Council and committee meetings the Corporation should consider purchasing the building. After some further discussion this was done the following year. Plans for alteration and extension were discussed, but the council had heavy financial commitments and only minor alterations were agreed and carried out in 1876<br><br>Although gutted by fire in 1902, then much extended and altered, the Commercial Street facade of Batley Town Hall is still essentially that of Michael's building, though a window replaces what was then the central door with steps down to the road.<sup>5</sup><a href="e63.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="&#169; Vivien Tomlinson 2004"></a> <br><br> In 1854 Michael Sheard's name was mentioned along with that of his father <a href="p2.htm#i75">Michael</a> in connection with the purchase of land at Healey on which the family's new home,<b> Dryfield House</b>, was to be built.<br> <br> He became the engineer and surveyor for the Board of Health which had been established in 1853.<sup>6</sup> <br>  In 1857 Michael Sheard was listed as Michael, jun, architect and engineer  still at Dryfield House at Batley.<sup>7</sup><br> He may have moved into Brookroyd House in 1857 or on his marriage the following year.<a href="e4.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Brookroyd House  &#169; Vivien E Tomlinson 2007"></a> <i>The previous occupants were Ellen Nussey, Charlotte Bronte's friend,  and two of her sisters,who left the house, which belonged to the manor of Batley, on the death of their mother.<sup>8</sup></i><br><br> <b><span style="font-size:13pt;">Hanover Street Congregational Church</span></b>,<br> This church in gothic style with an impressive spire was opened in the same year, but was to be extended ten years later in partnership with another architect. <a href="e272.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="&#169; image courtesy of Batley Community Archive"></a> <br><br>Michael Sheard married <a href="p40.htm#i1198">Anne <span class="ns">Scholefield</span></a>, daughter of <a href="p105.htm#i3141">Joshua <span class="ns">Scholefield</span></a> and <a href="p131.htm#i3938">Jane <span class="ns">Sykes</span></a>, on 26 June 1858 at Batley.<sup>9,10</sup> <br><br> <b><span style="font-size:13pt;">Batley Parish Church School</span></b> <br><br> in 1860 Michael Sheard was the architect of Batley Parish Church School and schoolhouse.  Building commenced in 1860 on a plot of land to the south of the Church  given by the Earl of Wilton, whose son, Viscount Grey de Wilton, laid the foundation stone on the 18th of June. The stonemasons were <a href="p125.htm#i3784">Peter <span class="ns">Thompson</span></a> and <a href="p125.htm#i3785">Charles <span class="ns">Thompson</span></a> Although the stonework was rather fine, the buildings  were old fashioned and neglected by the time of my grandfather Arthur Senior's headmastership. There is more about it in my account of him.<sup>11</sup><a href="e159.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Batley Parish Church School.  My grandmother Mrs Arthur Senior in the doorway of the Schoolhouse.  &#169; image collection V E Tomlinson"></a> <br><br>He was listed as the head of household in the  census  of 7 April 1861 at Brownhill, Batley, an Architect and surveyor. A visitor, Catherine Robinson, is also present.<sup>12</sup> <br>It is thought to have been in about in 1864 that he took on a young <a href="p10.htm#i272">Walter <span class="ns">Hanstock</span></a> as draughtsman/assistant. There would have been nothing unusual at the time in a man with Michael's background practicing as an architect and styling himself as such. Walter, however, had had a specifically architectural training, and clearly soon proved talented.<br><br> <b><span style="font-size:13pt;">Batley Cemetery</span></b><br><br>During the 1850s, faced with rapid population growth,  there had been growing concern about the inadequacy of the overcrowded churchyard, where the ground level had risen on account of so many layers of burials. proposals were considered for a separate cemetery if suitable land could obtained, and it was hoped that the Earl of Wilton would assist. The Earl, however donated extra land to enlarge the existing churchyard.<br> Some enlargements had been made to the Parish churchyard in the 1850s, but by the mid 1860s the lack of burial space in Batley had become acute again, and so a larger plot of land was purchased at Healey. Michael Sheard was appointed architect of the twin chapels on the crest of the hill. <a href="p10.htm#i272">Walter <span class="ns">Hanstock</span></a> is thought to have played a significant part in this scheme, but it is not clear if he was yet a partner, as early references only mention Michael.<br>An account of some buildings in Batley by W.S. Banks says:-<br><br><i>"The Batley Cemetery occupies twelve acres of sloping land, and has two decorated chapels, with a spire rising from the ground between them, and an excellent registrar's house. Mr Michael Sheard of Batley was the architect" </i><br>Kelly's Directory of 1881 says the cemetery was <i>"laid out in 1865 at a cost of &#163;12,500 and contains twelve acres with two gothic mortuary chapels from designs by Michael Sheard, Esq.<sup>13,14</sup></i><a href="e124.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="&#169; V E Tomlinson 2008"></a> <br>One who was to contribute much to Batley Cemetery in his work on many of the impressive memorials there was monumental mason/sculptor <a href="p260.htm#i7296">William <span class="ns">Rawden</span></a> and I wonder if it was news of the opportunities afforded by Michael's scheme that led him to return from America sometime in the 1860s.<br><br> <b><span style="font-size:13pt;">The Station Hotel</span></b><br><br>An impressive hotel was built to Michael's designs to house the many buyers and other guests who came to Batley, now well served by railways. <br><br>  In 1868 Michael Sheard was listed in a Building Trades Directory under Architects as:-<br><br><i>"SHEARD Michael, Batley, Yorkshire. -- pupil of the late Mr. Clapham, Wakefield. -- His works comprise West Riding Union Bank, Dewsbury; National Schools; Cemetery Chapels, Lodges, &c; St. Thomas's Church; and several Chapels in Batley; the Station Hotel for the Batley Station Hotel Company; Gas Works, and several warehouses in Soothill.--Is Surveyor to the Earl of Wilton's Batley Estate, and several other large estates in the district."</i><br><i>He was also listed in the same publication under the entries for civil engineers as:-<br>"SHEARD, Michael, Batley."<sup>15</sup></i> <br> <br><b><span style="font-size:13pt;">Zion Chapel</span></b><br><br>In that year came the building of this fine chapel which still graces Batley Market Place. <a href="e238.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a> <br> It seems likely that  <a href="p10.htm#i272">Walter <span class="ns">Hanstock</span></a> made a substantial contribution to this project headed by Michael , and his charming illustration of the scheme survives.<a href="e236.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a> <br>The organ, made by Francis Booth of Wakefield, was the one from the old Chapel built in 1855, and it seems likely that some alterations were made, and Michael drew up plans for the organ case which were approved by the trustees in 1869. <a href="e237.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Zion Chapel &#169; image V E Tomlinson"></a> <br><br><b><span style="font-size:13pt;">Batley Parish Church restoration</span></b> <br><br> in 1871 there were discussions about the future of Batley Parish Church, and some consideration seems to have been given as to whether it would be best to replace it with a new building on the site, as had just been done in Mirfield. It seems to the author fortunate that there was suffiicient local concern about this proposal for a decision to be made to restore the existing building, Batley's oldest monument.<a href="e62.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a> He kindly undertook to officiate as architect.<i> Discoveries made during the restoration process were of several scriptural texts in black lettering on on the walls, in accordance with injuctions in the reign of Elizabeth I,  and of the staircase leading to the rood loft which would have been removed in Tudor times.<sup>16</sup></i><br><br> He was listed as the head of household in the 2 April 1871 census at Brookroyd, Batley, <br>a Land agent and surveyor.

It includes some early wills and inscriptions from gravestones and from monuments within the Church, and is still a valuable source for family and local historians. <br><br> He is said himself to have had a splendid library including some exceedingly valuable books. <br> In the census of 3 April 1881 he was listed as the head of household at Brookroyd House, Batley, as a Land agent.<sup>21</sup><br> In the census of 5 April 1891 he was listed as the head of household at St. Albans, High Harrogate, Harrogate, as a Land agent aged 58.<sup>22</sup><br><br>  On 30 December 1891 Michael  saw the consecration of St Andrew's Church at Bruntcliffe, Morley, for which he had prepared the plans. <a href="e206.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="St Andrew's Church, Bruntcliffe"></a> <br><br><b><span style="font-size:13pt;">At Sutton in the Isle</span></b><br><br>In the census of 31 March 1901 he was listed as the head of household at Sutton House, Sutton, Ely, as a Land agent (retired) A cook and housemaid are kept.<sup>23</sup><br> <br>Why Michael moved to Sutton in the Isle is not yet clear, but this, a village on raised ground, is near to Ely itself, whose cathedral he must surely have loved. St. Andrew's at Sutton is an interesting church, and he wrote an article about it., published in 1908.<a href="e118.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="&#169; V E Tomlinson2008"></a> He describes in a clear and readable fashion the history and architecture of the church, analysing the sequence of its building with a practised eye. As with his work on Batley he allows himself no personal comment, save that he feels that the lowering of the chancel walls to accommodate a new roof marred the effect of a beautiful structure. Otherwise there is an interesting anecdote about the priest ejected during the Commonwealth, who, being possessed of &#163;120, bought some cows so his wife could run a dairy whilst he ran a school. <br><br> He died on 15 February 1911 at Sutton, Isle of Ely.<sup>5</sup>   He was buried there on 17 February 1911.<a href="e119.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="St. Andrew's Churchyard, Sutton"></a></div>

Not only were manufacturers doing extensive trade abroad, but also establishing shoddy and woollen mills overseas.</i>).<br> In the census of 30 March 1851 he was listed as a scholar the son of <a href="p2.htm#i75">Michael <span class="ns">Sheard</span></a> at Havercroft, Batley.<sup>2</sup> <br><br> George Sheard married <a href="p107.htm#i3182">Anne <span class="ns">Whitworth</span></a>, daughter of <a href="p107.htm#i3180">Charles <span class="ns">Whitworth</span></a> and <a href="p47.htm#i1380">Maria <span class="ns">Nightingale</span></a>, on 5 March 1857 at St. Peter's Church, Earlsheaton.<sup>3</sup><br><br> He was listed as the head of household in the 7 April 1861 census at Staincliffe Hill, Batley, as a woollen manufacturer.<sup>4</sup> By this time, with two small children and Annie pregnant again a housemaid and a nurse,  <a href="p294.htm#i8167">Roberta <span class="ns">Parker</span></a> and <a href="p294.htm#i8169">Emma <span class="ns">Roe</span></a> , are employed.<br>  In 1861 George was left one thousand two hundred and fifty pounds in his father's will, but this was part of a sum of money which George owed to his father on a promissory note. <br> In the 1860s he moved to Oakwell House, Birstall.<a href="e123.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a> <br> By now George had a second son, Percy,and a second daughter Florence was born in 1864,  but it was while living at Birstall that his elder son Charles Michael died and was buried in the Churchyard there. <br> He was listed as the head of household in the 2 April 1871 census at Oakwell, Gomersal, as a woollen manufacturer.<sup>5</sup> Two house servants are employed,  <a href="p294.htm#i8170">Emma Jane <span class="ns">Musgrave</span></a> and <a href="p294.htm#i8175">Emma <span class="ns">Birkett</span></a>. With a fine house with stabling George now also employed a groom, <a href="p292.htm#i8112">Henry <span class="ns">Firth</span></a>.<br><br> <b><span style="font-size:13pt;">Batley Trams</span> </b><br><br> in 1874 George Sheard was one of the first directors of the Dewsbury , Batley and Birstal Tramways Company which ran the original horse drawn trams. When he saw a trial of a Merryweather steam tram designed for use in Paris, George was impressed and wanted to have a fleet of them for Batley, but Parliament refused the necessary legislation for a time, so only in 1879 did this become possible.<sup>6</sup><a href="e127.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="The former Tram Depot , Bradford Road, Batley &#13; &#13;  &copy; Copyright Humphrey Bolton and   &#13;licensed for reuse under this Creative Commons Licence."></a> <br><br> George Sheard was a Governor of Batley Grammar School and Chairman of the managers of Batley Parish Church School.  <br><br><b><span style="font-size:13pt;">The Woodlands, now the Bagshaw Museum</span></b><br><br><b> in 1875 </b>George Sheard and <a href="p107.htm#i3182">Anne <span class="ns">Sheard</span></a> were living  at "The Woodlands",  a house designed for him by Sheard and Hanstock. Whilst Walter Hanstock is assumed responsible, one would that thought that Michael Sheard, George's brother, would have taken an interest in this scheme. We can, I think, assume my illustration to be Walter's work, for it closely resembles a watercolour of the house sometimes on view on the premises. this latter is signed by him and dated 1873, so was , I think, an illustration of what was yet to be built. <b> </b><a href="e67.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="&#169; collection Vivien E Tomlinson"></a> <br> I believe a site at Gomersal was considered, which would account for Lindstrum listing it as there, but in the event it was built at Upper Batley, on land held on a 999 year lease from the Earl of Wilton. There was an annual ground rent of &#163;66, but the building itself is said to have cost around &#163;25,000, an enormous sum at the time. <a href="e226.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a> <br>The house saw many lavish occasions. The grounds are said to have been beautifully kept, and were made available for local functions. We hear of many spectators there for the wedding of his daughter Florence, and would suppose the same to have been the case for the marriage of his elder daughter Fanny.<br><br> George's time at the mills saw many changes; power looms replaced hand looms, the <b>Hick Lane Mill</b> had to be rebuilt after a fire in 1876, and<b> Hick Well Mills</b> were bought from the Burnley family. His father had retired from the business by 1861, and brothers John and Joseph retired early and both died relatively young. This left George and Benjamin in charge, the former in charge of buying and manufacturing, and Benjamin in charge of finishing and selling. George was in sole charge after Benjamin's death in 1891. His son Percy and nephew Benjamin came into the firm, but George is said to have been unable to take a holiday for some years, until he felt they had learnt enough to take responsibility.<br> <br>He was listed as the head of household in the 3 April 1881 census at Upper Batley Lane, Batley, as a wol (sic) manufacturer.<sup>7</sup><br> There are now three new domestic staff at the Woodlands <a href="p293.htm#i8148">Mary A <span class="ns">Salman</span></a>, <a href="p295.htm#i8200">Emma <span class="ns">Day</span></a> and <a href="p294.htm#i8176">Hannah <span class="ns">Guyer</span></a>.<br> <a href="p295.htm#i8201">Frederick <span class="ns">Barker</span></a>, gardener would  have been living in the Lodge.<br><br> <b><span style="font-size:13pt;">Silver Wedding</span></b><br><br> in 1882 George Sheard and <a href="p107.htm#i3182">Anne <span class="ns">Sheard</span></a>  celebrated their Silver Wedding with a lavish Fancy Dress Ball.<a href="e126.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="&#169; image courtesy of Charles Nicholson"></a> The invitation gives a hint of the garb which George was to wear on this occasion, but he has not felt able to forego his habitual beard, which provides an amusing contrast with his outfit!<a href="e227.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="&#169; image courtesy of Charles Nicholson"></a> <br>There was a marquee on the lawn connected by a canvas passageway to the library entrance. Lighting was by gas lit chinese lanterns. There was a mishap when one of these ignited in the passageway, but luckily this was quickly put out and disaster averted. <br>There was dancing from eight o'clock until half past eleven, when supper was served.<br>I am pleased to see that the workpeople were not forgotten. We are told:-<br> "<i>The same afternoon the workpeople of Hick Lane and Hick Well Mills were entertained to tea in the warehouse of the last named mill, about 540 sitting down to the tables. The tea was provided by the Batley Coffee House Company, at the conclusion of which dancing was indulged in to the strains of Hemingway's string band. In the lower room, the younger portion of the workpeople entertained themselves in games &c., a plentiful supply of orange and lemonade being distributed amongst them. the proceedings broke up at about half-past eleven o'clock, not, however before ringing cheers had been given for Mr. and Mrs. Sheard and family."<sup>8</sup></i> <br><br>  George Sheard joined the Conservative party, and played an active role in local politics, becoming particularly prominent when his friend Joe Fox stood as candidate against the sitting MP, Serjeant Simon. Joe did not win , but won a substantial number of votes.  It was under his leadership that Batley's large Conservative club was built. <a href="e144.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a> <br>In 1889 An account in the Times said that George Sheard had been selected to stand as Conservative candidate for the Dewsbury seat, in opposition to Mr <a href="p235.htm#i6632">Mark <span class="ns">Oldroyd</span></a> ,  described as the Gladstonian member, but he decided not to stand.<sup>9</sup><br> <br>In the 5 April 1891 census he was listed as the head of household at The Woodlands, Batley, as a woollen manufacturer and J.P.  In one lodge is James Davis, gentleman's gardener, with wife and two children, and in the other Henry Firth, coachman, with wife and two children.<sup>10</sup><br>  George and <a href="p107.htm#i3182">Anne</a>  now employ a cook and two other domestic servants,, <a href="p294.htm#i8181">Isabella <span class="ns">Appleton</span></a>, <a href="p294.htm#i8180">Adelaide <span class="ns">Hanley</span></a> and <a href="p295.htm#i8190">Elizabeth <span class="ns">Davis</span></a>.<br> Both coachman Henry and new gardener <a href="p292.htm#i8121">James <span class="ns">Davis</span></a> are now living on the Woodlands premises.<br> <br>In the 31 March 1901 census he was listed as the head of household at Woodlands, Upper Lane, Batley, as a woollen manufacturer, employer. A ladies companion, cook, two housemaids and a kitchen maid are now employed, while in the lodges are the coachman, George Thompson, a widower, and James Davis the gardener and his family.<sup>11</sup><br><br>  In 1901 George was again pressed to be a candidate for the Dewsbury Constituency, but declined. <br> He died on 6 September 1902.<br> George's coffin was borne into Birstall Church by his  former coachman and gardener, <a href="p292.htm#i8112">Henry <span class="ns">Firth</span></a> and <a href="p292.htm#i8121">James <span class="ns">Davis</span></a>  and long-serving employees from Hick Lane and Hick Well Mills<br> and was buried on 9 September 1902 in the family vault  at Birstall where his elder son was buried.<sup>12</sup><br> <br>George Sheard's home later became a museum through the efforts of <a href="p82.htm#i2483">Walter <span class="ns">Bagshaw</span></a>.</div>

<div class="narr">      Michael <span class="ns">Sheard</span> was also known as<b> Michael the Elder</b> <br>      <i>a term presumably used at any time after the birth of his own son Michael, but particularly useful in distinguishing between their business interests when the latter was an adult, and when births in their families overlapped. Still useful to family historians attempting to differentiate between the various Michaels!</i><br><br> He was born circa 1776.<sup>1</sup> He was the son of <a href="#i101">George <span class="ns">Sheard</span></a> and <a href="p49.htm#i1439">Hannah <span class="ns">Blakeley</span></a>. <br>His baptism has not been found, and in first looking at this, although there were a few other Sheard researchers, none seemed to have made the connection with earlier parts of the tree. In fact his children's baptisms show him as Michael son of George in those useful Dade registers which show grandfathers' names, but because I had found the odd anomaly in these and this was an important link, I wanted to be sure, and looked for other evidence.<br><b><i>Thus:-</i></b><br><i>( i)  His childrens' names  names include a Hannah and a George after his parents<br>  (ii)  He married Sarah Lister, cousin of the Grace Lister his brother William married.<br>(iii)  His eldest son, William, was baptised 25.12.1796, the same day as Hannah,  daughter of another  supposed brother, George. (older, next in age)<br>(iv)  He was a witness at the marriage of above George Sheard and Ann Greenwood, on June 30th 1794. (signature resembles that at his own marriage.)<br>(v)    His marriage was witnessed by Isaac Newsome, husband of sister Mary, and Thomas Lister.(Sarah's brother)</i><br> <i>This exercise enabled me to clarify the connection with </i><b><i>Benjamin Law</i></b><i>'s second wife, who was known to have been a Sheard</i>.<br><br>  Michael Sheard was indeed a witness at the marriages of four of his siblings:-. <br> He witnessed the marriage of <a href="p17.htm#i498">Isaac <span class="ns">Newsome</span></a> and <a href="p41.htm#i1207">Mary <span class="ns">Sheard</span></a> on 28 May 1793 at Batley.<sup>2</sup><br> He witnessed the marriage of <a href="p4.htm#i106">George <span class="ns">Sheard</span></a> and <a href="p43.htm#i1285">Ann <span class="ns">Greenwood</span></a> on 30 June 1794 at Batley.<sup>2</sup><br><br> Michael Sheard himself married <a href="#i85">Sarah <span class="ns">Lister</span></a>, daughter of <a href="p42.htm#i1241">Hannah <span class="ns">Lister</span></a>, on 24 June 1795 at Batley. Michael signed the Register but Sarah made her mark.<sup>2</sup> <br><br> <i>He witnessed the second  marriage of his sister <a href="p4.htm#i104">Dinah <span class="ns">Briggs</span></a> to <a href="p101.htm#i3015">Sam <span class="ns">Reyner</span></a> on 27 January 1799 at Batley.<sup>2</sup></i><br> <i>He witnessed the marriage of <a href="p4.htm#i109">Hannah <span class="ns">Sheard</span></a> and <a href="p99.htm#i2971">Robert <span class="ns">Wilson</span></a> on 27 December 1802 at Batley.<sup>2</sup></i><br><br> As a child Michael probably expected a life like that of his father George, a clothier likely to have woven cloth at home on a hand loom, his wife spinning for him and the children helping with carding,  winding bobbins, and stretching the cloth on tenter frames to dry after fulling. For fulling, to de-grease and "felt-up" the coarsely woven woollens which Batley produced, it was generally necessary to take the cloth to the Dewsbury fulling mills, since Batley Beck was not sufficient to power water driven fulling stocks, powerful hammers which pounded the cloth, or indeed the new spinning and carding machines.<br><br>Two major developments were to affect Michael's life in the woollen trade:- <br> firstly the development of <b>steam power</b>. This made it possible to carry out fulling and other mechanised  processes locally. Batley clothiers clubbed together to found so called "<b>company mills</b>" to provide these facilities.<sup>3</sup><br> Secondly was the invention, of <b>Shoddy.</b>  Machines for tearing up rags to make stuffing already existed, but it was Batley clothier <a href="p7.htm#i202">Benjamin <span class="ns">Law</span></a> who realised that it might be possible to use such a process to form a material with a consistency that could be re-processed to form new cloth.<br><br>  In 1822 Michael Sheard and his son <a href="p2.htm#i75">Michael <span class="ns">Sheard</span></a> were listed as flushing manufacturers in Baines Directory.<sup>4</sup> <br><br> <b><span style="font-size:13pt;">Foundation of Hick Lane Mill</span></b><br><br> In 1823 Michael Sheard was a member of the Company which founded <b>Hick Lane Mill</b>, said by Willans to have been the first specifically for the making of cloth from Shoddy.<sup>5</sup> He and <a href="p8.htm#i227">Michael <span class="ns">Spedding</span></a> were two  of those mentioned in the fourth part of a deed as in occupation of  "that large and commodious scribbling and fulling mill lately erected" ------- this on a piece of land near Rouse Mill , and  mentioning  appurtenances and rights to draw water from Wooler Beck to work a steam engine or engines.<br>This must refer to Hick Lane Mill.<br><br> Since<b> Benjamin Law</b>'s wife <a href="p7.htm#i201">Lydia</a> was his cousin, it could have been through this connection that he was one of those drawn into this development of the new process. <br>  In 1829 Pigot's directory of Dewsbury lists  Michael  and George, Batley, as flushing and drugget manufacturers.<br>  In 1834 Pigot's directory of Dewsbury lists Sheard Michael & Son, Batley as flushing and drugget manufacturers<br>also Sheard Spedding and Co, Hick Lane Mills as scribbling and fulling millers.<sup>6</sup><br> <br> The death of <a href="p12.htm#i365">John <span class="ns">Burnley</span></a> in 1836 saw his heirs pulling out of the<b> Hick Lane Mill</b> , leaving Michael Spedding, Michael Sheard, Joseph Jubb and Phineas and David Fox.<sup>7</sup> <br><br> <b><span style="font-size:13pt;">Sheard Spedding and Co.</span> </b><br><br>This seems to have been the business associated with Hick Lane Mill. <br> In 1837 the firm of Sheard and Spedding was one of a number of local firms fined for offences against the Factory Acts.<br><br> Michael Sheard made a will on 29 November 1836; in which he left one of his four shares in Hick Lane Mill, then in the occupation of Messsrs Sheard, Spedding & Co., to his son George. The other three shares and his other properties were to be divided between his two elder sons <a href="#i90">George <span class="ns">Sheard</span></a>, <a href="p2.htm#i75">Michael <span class="ns">Sheard</span></a> and <a href="p73.htm#i2188">Joseph <span class="ns">Parker</span></a>.<br><br> Michael Sheard died on 4 February 1837.<sup>8</sup><br> He was buried on 9 February 1837 at Batley.<sup>2</sup><br> Michael Sheard's  gravestone survives in the Parish churchyard, and from it we learn of more children who died in infancy than are otherwise recorded, whilst the wording tells us that they died of consumption.<sup>8</sup><a href="e186.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Grave of Michael Sheard the elder; Batley All Saints.

<div class="narr">     Benjamin <span class="ns">Sheard</span> was born on 22 September 1809 at Batley. He was the son of <a href="#i84">Michael <span class="ns">Sheard</span></a> and <a href="#i85">Sarah <span class="ns">Lister</span></a>. Benjamin Sheard was baptized on 15 October 1809 at Batley.<br> He married <a href="p71.htm#i2147">Margaret <span class="ns">Gledhill</span></a>, daughter of <a href="p72.htm#i2166">Joseph <span class="ns">Gledhill</span></a> and <a href="p64.htm#i1941">Sarah <span class="ns">Briggs</span></a>, on 17 August 1829 at Batley witnesses George Newsome, John Chadwick.<sup>1</sup> <br> In the census of 6 June 1841 he was listed as the head of household at Havercroft, Batley, Innkeeper, with family & female servant Mariah Auty.<sup>2</sup><br> In the census of 30 March 1851 he was listed as the head of household at Havercroft, Batley, as a cloth manufacturer.<sup>3</sup><br><br> <i><i>It has been something of a puzzle as to what became of Benjamin after this, and the search for him has been very much a joint effort with several of us on his trail. It is now clear that he left England for Australia in  </i> 1852.<br></i><br> He sailed from Liverpool on the 1500 ton "<b>Delta</b>", a Liverpool "Eagle" Line packet, which was scheduled to leave for Melbourne on 17 July 1852.  This would have been a sailing ship, and a cheaper option, with fares at &#163;20 second class and &#163;50 first, than the thirty to eighty guinea fares for the 3500 ton steam ship "Great Britain" which was scheduled to make a voyage to Australia the following month.<sup>4</sup> <br>  On 19 October 1852 Benjamin was recorded as arriving in Australia on the Delta. He was an unassisted passenger, listed as a manufacturer, married, but travelling alone. We do not know the reason for his voyage, but it is conceivable that his mission was to buy wool. There were concerns at the time that the Gold Rush affecting Australia would lead to flocks of sheep being unattended, with consequent shortages.<sup>5,6</sup> <br><br> Wharever the original purpose, we now know that Benjamin remained in Australia, and was to have a second family there. <br>  On 4 September 1853 he made an apparently bigamous second marriage to <a href="p277.htm#i7747">Eliza <span class="ns">Downie</span></a>, daughter of <a href="p279.htm#i7793">Alexander <span class="ns">Downie</span></a>,  at St Francis Catholic Church, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.<sup>5,7</sup><a href="e274.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a> <br><br><i>His English family would seem to have still hoped for his return, and evidence found is in the form of an advertisement in the Melbourne press on 16 June 1855 asking a Benjamin Sheard who left Liverpool in July 1852 to communicate his address to a firm , Michaelis Boyd and Co. of 35 Flinders lane East, Melbourne. . This fits well with enquiries which would have been made following the provisions of his brother George's will, in which he was left &#163;200 subject to his presence in England at George's decease or within the following twelve months. Michaelis Boyd appear to be a firm of merchants and shipping agents and an understandable channel for such an enquiry.<sup>8</sup></i><br><br> Benjamin Sheard died on 23 June 1873 at 2 Block plt, Sydney road, Coburg, Bourke County, New South Wales, Australia, at age 63.<sup>7</sup></div>

I now believe this to be his third marriage. Witnesses were Jeremiah Chadwick and another name which is hard to read, possibly Webster. This explains a marriage which it has been hard to fit into my researches into the Batley Sheards, and a newspaper entry speaks of the groom aged 72 (this is a year out, but in his 72nd year) as father of nine, grandfather of forty-six, and great-grandfather of six all said to be living. If we discount some who died these numbers are of the right order for this George.  Elizabeth was said to be only 19!<sup>2,3</sup> <br></div>

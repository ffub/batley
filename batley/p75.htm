P., the first Mayor of the Borough of Batley, on the seventh day of May, 1869, being in the first year of his Mayoralty. The money has since been Transferred and invested in the names of the undermentioned Trustees, on Mortgage of the Rates, authorised to be levied by the Batley Waterworks Act, at the Interest of Five pounds per centum per annum: and such Interest is to be distributed amongst the Poor of Batley, annually on Christmas day, in accordance with the written Declaration of the Donor. Trustees,<br>Alderman Samuel Jubb, Esq.<br>Councillor Eli Ibberson<br>Mr William James Richardson Fox.<br>Mr John Joseph Jubb.<br>It is the Donor's wish that when the number of Trustees is reduced to Two, There shall be two additional Trustees elected by the Batley Town Council. The Mayor of Batley to be always a Trustee ex-officio in addition to the four appointed or elected Trustees, and ther be always some member or members of the Donor's family or connections (if any such can be found) in the Trust.<sup>5</sup><br></i> <br><br> It was at about this time that  he established the firm of John Jubb & son; <b> Phoenix Mills</b>, Batley.<br> In the census of 2 April 1871 he was listed as the head of household at Lamplands House, Batley, as a J.P., Alderman and Shoddy Manufacturer employing (no. unclear) men and 8 women.<sup>6</sup><br><br> He married <a href="p314.htm#i8678">Mary <span class="ns">FitzGeorge</span></a> on 24 June 1876 at Batley.<sup>1</sup> <br> <b>The Village Bard</b><br> John Jubb was also something of a Poet, and published a book of verse, "The Village Bard" Many of the verses in this were written as Sunday School hymns, but some comment on issues of the times. One, addressed to his father, concerns their anxieties about the arrival of a ship, the "Caroline Theresa" in Hull, from which they are expecting to unload goods, for shipping arrangements were part of trade. Others, early works if written when this was an issue, address the Corn Laws, which by prohibiting the import of foreign corn unless domestically produced corn reached a price of 80 shillings per quarter, benefitted agricultural interests, but not those of manufacturing districts.<br> Here workers had to spend much of their income on food, with less for manufactured goods, while European grain producers, without the benefit of exports to Britain, had less to spend on importing British goods.<br><br>Another was  <b>"Lines written on the Town of Batley"</b>which is a source of information on the changes in Batley in his time and how they were perceived. This can be read by clicking on the text image here. <a href="lines_written_jubb_full.rtf"><img src="docicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view text"></a> <br><br>In the census of 3 April 1881 he was listed as the head of household at Lamplands House, Batley, as a Merchant. Also present are niece Elizabeth Hepworth aged 27, two servants and a visitor, Ellen Law aged 30.<sup>7</sup><br><br> <a href="p16.htm#i463">Isaac <span class="ns">Binns</span></a> has a reference to John Jubb's career, since he was sitting in on proceedings some years after John's retirement from the Council :- <br><br>"<i>when certain subscribers presented Mr John Jubb, J.P., with a life-size portrait of himself - which Mr. Jubb at once presented to the town. During that meeting Mr. Jubb referred to the growth of the town, and also his long connection with it. Neartly every position in which a gentleman can do duty to the ratepayers has been filled by Mr. Jubb, and his memory goes back to the old Commissioners of Highways. At that time the yearly meetings , if not all the meetings of the local authority were held at the"Church Steps," otherwise the "Fleece Inn," in "Stocks Lane." Johnny Wharton was the surveyor, and collector of rates and poor rates; and in those days eloquent Snowdens and fighting Fox's were not known in local Parliamentary life. But the "Jubbses" were: for Mr. Jubb was a member then and when the Local Board was formed he was so prominent a member that he was made into the first chairman. That he took an active interest in local matters afteerwards is proved by his receiving the honour of being elected in 1868 to the civic chair - and filling the position of our first mayor.<sup>8</sup></i><br> He died on 20 March 1888.<br><br></div>

He draws attention to facilities which make Batley suited to the woollen industry, its proximity to several local markets, and its ample supply of water. Whist acknowledging that the beck is not a substantial stream, he comments that Batley had the benefit of underground water which could readily be pumped for dyeing and bleaching. He gives an account of how wool was prepared for spinning in earlier days, and conveys a scene of domestic industry with,<i> "probably, the father engaged in tumming and carding, the son weaving, and others of the family warping the web and winding the bobbins" </i>a picture reminiscent of Daniel Defoe's description of the scene around Halifax in the seventeen-twenties.<br>He tells of improved machinery and the introduction of steam power, and gives us an account of <b>the Old Mill</b> founded by a Company of clothiers in 1897. <br> The first use of Shoddy he dates to 1813, and says the presumption is in favour of it first being produced by &#28;&#28; <a href="p7.htm#i202">Benjamin <span class="ns">Law</span></a>.<sup>6,7</sup> A vague comment which aroused some indignation when spotted later by Law's grandson Edwin. He tells us something of rag machines, and how the trade developed, with figures giving an indication of the enormous scale to which it had grown, and the types of cloth in which it was used, and production methods.<br><br> In the census of 7 April 1861 he was listed as the head of household at Up Lane, Batley, as a Woollen Cloth Manufacturer.<sup>8</sup><br> Samuel Jubb was elected Mayor of Batley on 9 November 1870.<br> In the census of 2 April 1871 he was listed as the head of household at Woodfield House, Batley, as Alderman, Mayor, and Woollen Manufacturer.

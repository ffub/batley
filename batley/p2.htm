<div class="narr">     Charles <span class="ns">Blackburn</span> was born in 1839 at Batley.<br> He was the son of <a href="#i63">William <span class="ns">Blackburn</span></a> and <a href="#i64">Sarah <span class="ns">Thompson</span></a>. Charles Blackburn was baptized on 23 November 1839 at Batley.<sup>1</sup><br><br> In the census of 6 June 1841 he was listed as the son of <a href="#i64">Sarah <span class="ns">Blackburn</span></a>.<sup>2</sup><br> In the census of 30 March 1851 he was listed as a woollen assistant, the son of <a href="#i64">Sarah <span class="ns">Blackburn</span></a>.<sup>3</sup><br><br> Charles Blackburn has not been found in censuses in England after this, and it has seemed likely that he was living  in Berlin.<br><br> <b><span style="font-size:13pt;"> Charles Blackburn and the Berlin Sailing Club</span></b><br><br> Confirmation that Charles was in Berlin in the 1860s has come from a surprising source; enthusiastic sailors in Berlin researching the history of the Berlin Sailing Club, first formed in 1867, of which he was a founder member. There are indications that he had earlier taken part in the burgeoning sport of regatta sailing on the waters of East Berlin, and he participated in the club's first regatta with his yacht "Warrior". A Mr Jachmann often skippered for him, perhaps a relative of his wife. For a time Charles was president of the club, and later honorary chairman. Interestingly in the development of the history of competitive sailing, another member of an English family he must have known was Edward Drory, whose father had come to Berlin in the 1830s to set up a gas supply. It was through Edward's connection with the gas business that he moved to Austria where he was co- founder of the Union Yacht Club.<sup>4</sup> <br><br> He married <a href="p101.htm#i3034">Theresa Agnes Laura <span class="ns">Jachmann</span></a> at Berlin The children listed below are those of a Carl Blackburn and Therese Agnes Laura Jachmann.  The middle daughter Wilhelmine's other names are those of her English grandmother and great grandmother.<br> We first find him  in a Berlin  Directory in 1873 where his name is alongside that of his brother John at a Shoddy and Mungo factory on Engel-ufer, now Engeldamm.<sup>5</sup> <br><br>  In 1883 Charles  won a Berlin sailing Trophy with his yacht "Nameless." <br> It seems the Sailing Club lost its identity for a time in the mid 1880s through a merger, but it was largely through Charles's efforts that it was re-founded in 1885.<sup>4</sup> <br><br> <b><span style="font-size:13pt;">Charles Blackburn at Kopenick</span></b> <br><br> Charles Blackburn purchased part of <a href="p1.htm#i49">John <span class="ns">Blackburn</span>'s</a> business interests in Berlin around 1891.  In 1893 Charles Blackburn was listed in a directory apparently replacing John.<sup>5</sup> <br>  In 1896 Charles Blackburn was recorded as the owner of the mill at Kopenick, and at this time there was some rebuilding there following a fire. A carbonising drum was installed for filling with hydrochloric acid to remove cotton. Charles continued to be listed in directories as a manfacturer of shoddy cloth (Kunstwolle) and also as a rag merchant.<sup>6</sup> <br><br>  In 1898 Charles Blackburn appears on the 1878/1879 membership list of the Berlin Sailing Club along with other Blackburns, a Charles junior, John, possibly his cousin who we know was in Berlin for a time,  <a href="p112.htm#i3326">Mark <span class="ns">Blackburn</span></a> , his nephew, and a Max Blackburn.<sup>4</sup><a href="e301.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Membership list of Berlin Sailing Club. &#169; image courtesy of Jutta Boergers and  G&#246;tz Gaertner."></a> <br><br> In 1899 Charles was in Batley for the funeral of his cousin George Blackburn.<sup>7</sup> <br> In later life Charles was drawn back to Wendisch Rietz on the Scharm&#252;tzelsee, a lake to the south-east of Berlin where he had sailed, and spent summers on a houseboat there.<sup>4</sup> <br> He died on 25 July 1914 shortly before the outbreak of the first World War.<sup>4</sup></div>

It may have been soon after this that he and Sarah moved into Dryfield House, his parents' former home. The house was actually left to Richard Arthur, the youngest son, and the only child still at home, but there must have been some family arrangement made, for Richard Arthur seems to have moved out on his marriage.<br><br> <span style="font-size:13pt;"><b>Hick Well Mills</b></span><u> </u> <br> in 1861 Burnleys' Hick Well Mills were offered for sale, and presumably it was at this time that the Sheards purchased them. The sale particulars mention rag grinding rooms and also additional land and nineteen cottages. <br><br> Sheards appear to have been at this time in possession of <b>The Old Mill. </b> It may have been as a consequence of the<b> Hick Well</b> purchase that the Sheards were to offer it for sale. <a href="p1.htm#i49">John <span class="ns">Blackburn</span></a> was to purchase it in 1862.<sup>7</sup><br><br> <span style="font-size:13pt;"><b>A Civic Role</b></span><br> in 1869 John Sheard was elected a member of the new Town Council for the West Ward, being described as a moderate Liberal in politics.

Michael Sheard was baptized on 29 April 1798 at Batley.<br> He married <a href="#i76">Sarah <span class="ns">Newsome</span></a>, daughter of <a href="p4.htm#i113">Abraham <span class="ns">Newsome</span></a> and <a href="p4.htm#i114">Hannah <span class="ns">Sheard</span></a>, on 3 April 1820 at Batley Witnesses were David Sheard and Jo Chadwick.<sup>1</sup><br>  In 1822 Michael Sheard and his father <a href="p3.htm#i84">Michael <span class="ns">Sheard</span></a> were listed as flushing manufacturers in Baines Directory.<sup>2</sup> <br>  In 1834 Michael Sheard was listed in Pigot's Dewsbury directory as:- <br>Sheard Michael, jun. Batley, flushing and drugget manufacturer.<sup>3</sup><br> He was one of the executors and a beneficiary of the will of his father <a href="p3.htm#i84">Michael <span class="ns">Sheard</span> the Elder</a>. If, as eldest son, he seems less generously provided for than the next but one son, George, this may reflect that he was already established in business on his own account.<br>  In 1838 Michael Sheard  gave his workmen a dinner to celebrate the royal coronation.<sup>4</sup> <br> <br> He soon moved to a new house at the Hick Lane end of Commercial Street, which is said to have borne the inscription M.S.S. 1840.<br>His father's will had mentioned looms and jennies, but these were still hand machines, and could have been housed alongside domestic premises.<sup>5</sup><br> In the census of 6 June 1841 he was listed as the head of household at Havercroft, Batley, as a Cloth manufacturer.<sup>6</sup><br>  In 1842 an entry in a Leeds Directory for Mcl and Son as Flushing, etc. manufacturers may now refer to Michael with his eldest son. <br> In the 30 March 1851 census he was listed as the head of household at Havercroft, Batley, as a cloth manufacturer, firm of 3 listed as employing 350 hands.<sup>7</sup><br><br>  In 1852 <a href="p107.htm#i3190">Joseph <span class="ns">Megson</span></a> , who had married the sister of Michael Sheard the younger,was described as agent for<b> Messrs Michael Sheard</b> and <b>Sheard and Senior</b> when he gave a dinner for between 30 and 40 weavers at the Flying Horse Inn, Ossett Street on the 10th of April.<sup>8</sup> <br><br> <b><span style="font-size:13pt;">Hick Lane Mill</span> </b><br> <br>Willans tells us that Sheards bought the shares of other partners in Hick Lane and added mill after mill, taking the first one down entirely and rebuilding it.  Much of this seems to have happened in this Michael's time, with the Old Mill and Valley Mills in Sheard occupation.<sup>9</sup><br><br> By this time the old jennies would have been replaced by better machinery in the mills, and  power looms<br> would have been introduced, though still supplemented by out work on hand looms.<br><br> <b><span style="font-size:13pt;">Sheard and Spedding </span> </b>continued to be listed in directories until in 1854 , the year before his brother George's death, the partnership was dissolved.<sup>10</sup><br><br>  In 1854 Michael Sheard  purchased 3 closes of land at Healey from members of the Woodhead family of Gomersal. It is interesting that this transaction was made in his name and that of his fourth son, another  <a href="p3.htm#i81">Michael</a> , described as land surveyor and just becoming established as an architect.<br> By 1857 Michael Sheard and family had moved into their new house at Healey, and at Dryfield House, an elegant residence set back from the road with a carriage drive, were able to live in some style.<a href="e140.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Dryfield House  &#169; V E Tomlinson 2004"></a> According to James Willans  <a href="p251.htm#i7063">Eli <span class="ns">Ibberson</span>'s</a> drapery business later occupied  Michael's former residence.<sup>9</sup><br> <br> On 1 January 1857 Michael Sheard withdrew from the business partnership with his three elder sons, beig replaced by his fourth son, George.<sup>10</sup>  <br> In 1858 Michael Sheard was listed as a manufacturer and merchant, Dryfield House,  Michael Sheard & Sons were listed as scribbling & fulling millers  at Old and Valley Mills. and also an  entry for woollen manufacturers says M.S. & Sons (Joseph and John) Residence given as Dryfield House.<sup>11</sup><br><br> <b><span style="font-size:13pt;">Valley</b> <b>Mills</span></b>.<br> <br>It isn't yet clear when Valley Mills was built, but whereas Hick Lane Mill has gone, and Hick Well consists largely of later buildings, it looks to me as though what survives of Valley Mill may be part of the original. The section with the tall blocked up window visible in my left hand photograph could, by comparison with other early mills, be where the engine was located. The other photo shows the building from the other side, where again this part shows as a projection. Beyond it the brickwork looks later; one would suppose there to have been once an adjacent chimney.<a href="e98.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a> <br><br>I do not know if it was Michael Sheard's mills <a href="p153.htm#i4509">Walter <span class="ns">White</span></a> visited in 1858 but he gives a good description of what would have been happening there at that time which can be read by clicking on his name.<sup>12</sup><br> Michael Sheard made a will on 2 January 1861.<sup>13</sup><br> In the census of 7 April 1861 he was listed as the head of household at Dryfield House, Healey, Batley, as a manufacturer, out of business. Adjacent entries give gardener William Kershaw and coachman Charles Oliver with families.<sup>14</sup><br> He died on 23 June 1861 at Batley at age 63.<br> He was buried on 26 June 1861 at Batley ; with three children who died in infancy, Matilda, Edwin and David.<sup>15</sup></div>

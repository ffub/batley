He survived, but she tells of the men's faces being completely blackened with the smoke and powder of ammunition, and of his gun barrel being so hot from repeated firing that he had to hold it with his cuff.

<div class="itp" id="i5650"><h2 class="sn">Catherine Whitaker</h2>
<div class="sinfo">#5650, b. 6 January 1779, d. 20 April 1857</div>
<div class="narr">     Catherine <span class="ns">Whitaker</span> was born on 6 January 1779 at Leeds. <br>Catherine Whitaker married <a href="#i5649">Joshua <span class="ns">Exley</span></a>, son of <a href="p239.htm#i6751">Joshua <span class="ns">Exley</span></a> and <a href="p239.htm#i6752">Hannah <span class="ns">Murfitt</span></a>, on 19 October 1806 at Leeds Both made their marks.<sup>1</sup> <br><br> <span style="font-size:13pt;"><b>A Batley woman in the Peninsular War</b></span><br> The first years of Catherine's marriage were adventurous and difficult ones, of which she left her own acount.<br> Soon after their marriage her husband was called away on service, initially to Jersey. Catherine followed, we are told, on foot to Southampton from where she sailed. After some months in Jersey, then the Isle of Wight, she had to return to Batley, not being allowed to accompany the regiment to Madeira since she was heavily pregnant. Back in Batley, she came under the care of the poor house, but there still under the old poor law regime, she was afforded every comfort. <br>Shipping was still at the mercy of the winds, and her husband ended up not in Madeira, but in Chichester for a time, where she and new born infant joined him. After Chichester they spent some months in Jersey, but they went to Portugal. Catherine tells leave permission for her to go was sought by the colonel from the general, and I understand that with this granted she would have been considered as on the strength of the regiment. We hear of fever striking the regiment, and her husband being direct to attend to the sick, but then succumbing to fever himself. We hear of the battle of Albuera, and of  the reception of Wellington at Elva, of travels around Spain when at times the French seemed in a strong position, of seeing Wellington himself before the battle of Salamanca. The women were with the baggage wagons, and we hear of miserable conditions after, with torrential rain and Catherine trying to save a little of some braed she had obtained for her husband, whose only sustenance had been a few acorns.<sup>1</sup> <br><br> Soon after the battle of Vittoria in 1813 there was another engagement with the enemy, and Catherine was given to understand that her husband had been killed,though she was unable to find his body.<br>She was given some money and a kind of passport for the journey home, and made her way back to Batley. There she was told that Joshua's mother had had a letter from him, and that he was alive but a prisoner of war.  Though released after nine months, this experience had damaged his health, but after some recuperation in Bordeaux he was able to ship for Ireland. <br><br> Catherine set out to join her husband , and had a stormy crossing to Dublin with an intoxicated crew. Reports of this voyage led Joshua to believe that the ship had been wrecked, and that he had lost his wife.She was able to find out where he was, and on arriving at her destination, found the Sergeant major, son of old William Woffenden of Batley, was in the act of writing to her sending &#163;1 remittance. This was <a href="p240.htm#i6773">Squire <span class="ns">Woffenden</span></a> , a sergeant major in Joseph's regiment who would have been in Ireland at the time.<br> In the census of 6 June 1841 she was listed as the head of household at New Road Side, Batley, aged 60.<sup>2</sup><br> In the census of 30 March 1851 she was listed as the head of household at 21 J Ward's Hill, Batley, as a widow, a bobbin winder aged 71.<sup>3</sup><br> Catherine Exley died on 20 April 1857 at age 78.<sup>1</sup><br> She was buried on 22 April 1857.<sup>4</sup> <br> <br><a href="p16.htm#i463">Isaac <span class="ns">Binns</span></a> r<i>ecalled a childhood visit to Catherine, here referred to as  Kate.  He knew of her as a soldier's widow who had followed the army through the Peninsular campaign and published in her later years, by the aid of friends, the account of her travels mentioned above, from which he understands the profits to have been used to augment her slender income.  His recollections are rather of  her home, a one room cellar dwelling reached by a few steps, and Kate seated at a round table in the middle of the room.<sup>5</sup>  </i></div>
